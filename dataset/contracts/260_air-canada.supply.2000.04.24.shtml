WHEREAS LMGC wishes to purchase airline tickets from Airline, and Airline has agreed to sell airline tickets to LMGC, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; AND WHEREAS terms used herein have the meanings set forth in Schedule A hereto and the principals of interpretation set out therein apply to this Agreement; NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties now agree as follows: ARTICLE 1 RIGHT TO PURCHASE 1.1 RIGHT TO PURCHASE. (a) Starting on May 1, 2000 and thereafter throughout the Term, LMGC shall have the right to buy Special Tickets from Airline and each Regional Airline, and Airline will make available, and either cause each of the Regional Airlines to make available or obtain itself from each such Regional Airline and make available, for purchase by LMGC, Special Tickets, at the Special Fares and otherwise on the terms and conditions hereof. Airline shall also use its best efforts to cause CAI (so long as it is not a Regional Airline (and as a result, subject to the previous sentence)) to comply with the terms of this Agreement in all respects (including supplying Special Tickets for Airline Seats at the Special Fares) as if it were a Regional Airline. Any reference herein to the purchase by LMGC of Special Tickets or Airline Seats includes any such purchase by any Subsidiary of LMGC (including LMG Travel) and Airline agrees that any such Subsidiary may purchase Special Tickets hereunder at the Special Fares. (b) During the Initial Period (but subject to Section 1.2), LMGC may purchase Special Tickets at the Special Fares for any Airline Seats offered by Airline or any Regional Airline. During the Additional Period, however, LMGC may only purchase Special Tickets at the Special Fares for itineraries which (i) include a **** Route or (ii) do not include a **** Route because of the exclusion set out in Schedule I where the segment from Schedule I is part of a larger itinerary that does not have other **** as described in Section 1.9(b). **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 2 1.2 CAPACITY. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, during the Initial Period LMGC shall (and shall be entitled to) book Special Tickets in **** Class and shall be entitled to the priority currently associated therewith (not to be lower than that available to any other Person booking into **** Class). Except as otherwise provided herein, during the Additional Period LMGC shall (and shall be entitled to) book Special Tickets in a class to be designated by Airline which may, but need not be, **** Class, and which will satisfy the requirements for the Additional Period set out herein (the "Other Class"). (b) Airline agrees to load and maintain the Special Fares in **** Class during the Initial Period and in the Other Class during the Additional Period, and make such Special Fares accessible in SABRE throughout the Term and to give LMGC and LMG Travel (and no one else outside of Airline or a Regional Airline) access to such fares. No other Person or entity entitled to book into **** Class at any time will have greater rights thereto or to the capacity provided thereby, than LMGC. Airline represents and warrants to LMGC that the following statements regarding **** Class are now true and covenants that such statements will be true (subject to Section 1.2(c) below) throughout the Term: (i) **** Class is loaded such that it is accessible in SABRE and can be viewed by LMGC within SABRE, (ii) it is available on every route of Airline and all Regional Airlines, (iii) it is always initially set to more than **** on each existing route, (iv) it regularly provides an initial availability for a route when set of at least **** percent of the seats available on the route, excluding business class or superior seats, including first class; (v) there are no partitions in such class that would affect LMGC and block bookings are only permitted in such class on an infrequent basis; and (vi) the class is intended for **** and similar Persons, including, as of the date hereof, **** which currently books tickets only into such class, and certain public fares such as youth, student and similar fares. The parties have discussed LMGC's current and projected needs and flight patterns for Airline Seats and a description of such needs is attached as Schedule H hereto. Airline confirms that it is its expectation that LMGC's rights to book into **** Class as contemplated hereby will generally satisfy those needs during the Initial Period, although it gives no warranty as to availability on specific flights or routes, and LMGC confirms that it is its expectation that it will book to its forecasts, as reflected in Schedule H, during the Initial Period, although it gives no warranty as to what actual levels of bookings will be. If, notwithstanding the **** and **** capacity guarantees set out in Section 1.3, LMGC determines that, for a period of at least 60 days during the Initial Period, it is generally not able to meet such needs in respect of itineraries commencing on or after September 1, 2000, it may notify Airline thereof and in such event Airline will determine and implement some other approach that will enable such needs to be generally met, including, if required to resolve the issue, allowing LMGC to book into some other class or creating a separate booking class for LMGC to book into during the Initial Period. (c) If at any time or from time to time during the Initial Period, Airline changes its booking classes so that **** Class no longer exists or makes any material changes to the parameters associated with such class, Airline shall designate another booking class into which LMGC shall be entitled to book Special Tickets and which will provide LMGC with substantially the same **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 3 parameters as described in Section 1.2(b). For purposes hereof, any such replacement class shall thereafter be referred to as "**** Class". (d) The parties will meet annually to review the concept of LMGC being permitted access to the capacity provided from time to time by Airline under "web specials" made available on Airline's web site. Such access would be provided in order to permit LMGC to assist Airline in utilizing such capacity, by issuing Special Tickets therefrom to its Collectors. The price payable by LMGC for any Airline Seats booked therefrom shall not be any greater than the applicable Special Fare at such time, but any such Airline Seats shall be subject to the same conditions as provided in the relevant web special. Airline will allow LMGC reasonable access on such basis to book Special Tickets from at least one such web special during the Initial Period, but otherwise Airline has no obligation to provide LMGC such access. LMGC's rights under this Section 1.2(c) are in addition to, and not in limitation of, its capacity entitlements under the balance of this Section 1.3. 1.3 CAPACITY GUARANTEE. (a) The provisions of Sections 1.3(b) and (c) below shall apply only in respect of itineraries booked by LMGC for the period on or after September 1, 2000 and LMGC acknowledges that Airline cannot commit to such capacity guarantees for itineraries prior thereto. Airline shall however use its commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that LMGC's needs for capacity are satisfied in respect of itineraries prior thereto. (b) Subject to Section 1.3(a), Airline shall ensure that, at all times during the Term, for each **** day period which commences at least **** days after such time, the total of: (i) all Airline Seats of Airline and each Regional Airline on each **** Route which are available to be booked by LMGC at the Special Fares on flights departing in such **** day period, plus (ii) all Airline Seats of Airline and each Regional Airline on such **** Route which at such time have been booked by LMGC at the Special Fares for flights departing in such **** day period, is at least **** of the aggregate Airline Seats offered by Airline and the Regional Airlines for such **** day period on such **** Route. (c) In addition, but again subject to Section 1.3(a), Airline shall also ensure that, at all times during the Term, for each **** day period which commences at least **** days after such time, the total of: (i) all Airline Seats of Airline and each Regional Airline on each **** Route, and on each **** Route shown in Schedule I, which are available to be booked by LMGC at the Special Fares on flights departing in such **** day period, plus **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 4 (ii) all Airline Seats of Airline and each Regional Airline on such **** Route or such **** Route, as applicable, which at such time have been booked by LMGC at the Special Fares for flights departing in such **** day period, is at least **** of the aggregate Airline Seats offered by Airline and the Regional Airlines for such **** day period on such **** Route or such **** Route, as applicable. For greater certainty, LMGC acknowledges that during the Additional Period it can only purchase Special Tickets at the Special Fares for the purposes described in the second sentence of Section 1.1(b) and accordingly the capacity guarantee set out in this Section 1.3(c) only applies during the Additional Period with respect to itineraries that meet those requirements. 1.4 INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY. If at any time LMGC, acting reasonably, determines (whether from reviewing the reports Airline provides under Section 1.7, from a review of SABRE or otherwise) that the capacity made available to LMGC on a **** Route or **** Route with respect to a particular **** day period that has not been completed does not comply with Section 1.3, LMGC may notify Airline thereof. If Airline has not remedied the situation to the reasonable satisfaction of LMGC within 72 hours thereafter, LMGC shall be entitled to book Special Tickets on such **** Route or **** Route, as applicable, in any other economy booking classes in order to ensure that it has the capacity required under Section 1.3 with respect to such **** day period, and the fares payable by LMGC for such Special Tickets shall still be the Special Fares. Similarly, if at any time LMGC determines that it was not provided sufficient capacity on a **** Route or **** Route with respect to any particular **** day period that has then been completed, it may notify Airline thereof. If Airline has not remedied the situation to the reasonable satisfaction of LMGC within 72 hours thereafter, LMGC shall be entitled, for the **** day period thereafter and in addition to the capacity otherwise provided hereunder on such **** Route or **** Route, as applicable, to book additional Airline Seats at the Special Fares in any other economy booking classes in a number sufficient to make up the deficiency for that particular **** day period. In selecting other classes to look to for purposes of this Section 1.4, LMGC shall review the available classes in order of priority, starting with the lowest priority as advised to LMGC from time to time by Airline in writing. If, as a result of booking Special Tickets in any such other class for which the Special Fares have not been loaded, LMGC pays an amount therefor greater than the Special Fares, Airline shall promptly make any required adjustments in connection therewith. 1.5 OTHER REQUIREMENTS. Airline shall, and shall ensure that each Regional Airline shall, comply with Schedule D hereto. In addition, the terms of this Agreement will be subject to the reservations, commissions, travel, ticket use and other procedures and requirements as set forth in Schedule C hereto. 1.6 TREATMENT OF PASSENGERS HOLDING TICKETS. Except as described in Schedule C, Airline shall, and shall ensure that each Regional Airline shall, treat and serve each passenger holding a Special Ticket in the same manner as each other economy passenger of Airline or such Regional Airline, as applicable, including as to loading priorities, entitlement to denied boarding **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 5 compensation, flight cancellation compensation, baggage limits, or any disruption or compensation, all in accordance with applicable industry tariffs and conditions of carriage. 1.7 REPORTS AND AUDITS. On or before the 15th day of each month during the Term, Airline shall provide LMGC with a report in mutually agreed upon form showing both projected and historical data and, at a minimum, showing, for at least each of the three months immediately thereafter, (i) those routes for which there is no availability to LMGC in such month, (ii) those routes for which there is low and rapidly diminishing capacity to LMGC in such month, and (iii) those routes for which there is sufficient capacity to LMGC in such month. Availability for this purpose shall be determined by availability in the class or classes into which LMGC is then booking hereunder and based on the aggregate number of Airline Seat available on such routes during such month. LMGC shall have the right, on reasonable notice to Airline and during normal business hours and no more than twice each calendar year, to engage an independent third party to audit Airline's records in order to confirm the accuracy of such reports, and in each case the cost of such audit shall be paid by LMGC unless any such audit reveals that the capacity shown to be available to LMGC in a report was incorrect by more than 5%, in which case Airline shall pay the cost of such audit. 1.8 PROTECTION OF PROGRAM. Title to the Program, AMRM and all rights represented thereby or related thereto, are reserved at all times to LMGC. LMGC may determine, in its sole discretion, the duration, form, scope and content of the Program and may effect termination, addition, deletion or other modification or change thereof or thereto as it may, in its sole discretion, determine. For greater certainty, this Section 1.8 is not intended to give LMGC the right to change the Program in a manner that would reduce its obligations hereunder. 1.9 DETERMINATION OF **** ROUTES AND **** ROUTES. (a) On each January 1 during the Term, Schedule G setting out the **** Routes shall be deemed amended to consist of each **** Route in respect of which no Air Carrier (other than Airline, CAI or any Regional Airline of either) provides **** (whether or not ****) **** service as of the November 15 immediately prior thereto utilizing planes with seating capacity for at least **** passengers. (b) On each January 1 during the Term, Schedule I shall be deemed amended to consist of each **** Route in respect of which an Air Carrier (other than Airline, CAI or any Regional Airline of either) provides **** (whether or not ****) **** service as of the November 15 immediately prior thereto utilizing planes with seating capacity for at least **** passengers. (c) If at any time the parties are unable to agree by December 15th of any year, for purposes of Section 1.9(a) or (b) above, as to the **** Routes to be described in Schedule G or the **** Routes to be described in Schedule I, either party may refer the matter to confidential and binding arbitration under the ARBITRATIONS ACT (Ontario) before a single arbitrator who shall be instructed to provide his or her determination as soon as possible. The cost thereof shall be split equally between the parties. In the event of such a referral, the applicable schedule **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 6 shall only be amended under this Section 1.9 on the date of such determination, and such determination shall be final and binding for purposes of this Section 1.9. ARTICLE 2 FARES 2.1 SPECIAL FARES. (a) The Special Fares as of May 1, 2000 are as set out in Part 1 of Schedule B. On January 1, 2001, the Special Fares will be adjusted with respect to all Special Tickets purchased on or after that date to the amounts set out in Part 2 of Schedule B. On ****, the Special Fares will be adjusted with respect to all Special Tickets purchased on or after that date to the amounts set out in Part 3 of Schedule B.

If for any reason whatsoever (including the CCAA Plan not being approved or no amounts being distributed to unsecured creditors thereunder by December 31, 2000), Airline has not paid LMGC **** as contemplated in Section 5.3 by December 31, 2000, the price increases contemplated for **** and **** shall not take place but shall be replaced by a **** price increase from the amounts set out in Part 3 of Schedule B on each such date. (b) For each Special Ticket purchased by LMGC hereunder, LMGC shall pay Airline the applicable Special Fare. The Special Fares exclude any applicable transportation tax, excess baggage charges, airport taxes, federal inspection fees, passenger facility charges, departure taxes, GST, sales, transfer or use taxes, or any similar taxes, levies or charges, or any other ancillary duties and charges (collectively, "Additional Charges") and LMGC shall either pay or cause its Collectors to pay to Airline any applicable Additional Charges. Infants (i.e. under 2 years old) who do not occupy a separate Airline Seat shall be carried free of charge, except for any applicable Additional Charges and except as otherwise required by applicable law or by regulations or policies applicable to the airline industry. 2.2 ADDITIONAL PAYMENT. As soon as possible, but in any event by July 1, 2000, Airline shall dedicate at least one employee exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the responsibilities and having the job position and qualifications described in Schedule E hereto. In consideration of Airline fulfilling such responsibility, LMGC shall, within 30 days of such person being hired, pay to Airline an amount (which shall apply in respect of the period from the date of hire up to and including December 31, 2000) determined based on pro rating **** over the period left in the 2000 calendar year from the date of such hire. Within 30 days following commencement of each subsequent calendar year during the Term, LMGC shall pay an additional **** to Airline. The amount so paid by LMGC shall be applied on account of the salary due to such individual and other related expenses of Airline in connection therewith. If the Term ends part way through any calendar year, Airline shall provide LMGC with a proportionate rebate of the amount so paid. In addition, if at any time such position remains vacant during a calendar year for more than 60 days in aggregate or such individual fails to fulfil **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 7 the responsibilities set out in Schedule E, LMGC shall also be entitled to a proportionate rebate of the amount paid based on the total period during which such position remained vacant or during which such individual so failed to fulfil such responsibilities. ARTICLE 3 TERM 3.1 TERM. This Agreement shall be come into effect as of May 1, 2000 and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter until December 31, 2004, at which time this Agreement shall terminate, provided that Airline shall still be bound to honour any Special Tickets purchased hereunder on or prior to the termination date which have a travel date which occurs thereafter and shall comply with Section 1.6 in connection therewith notwithstanding such termination. 3.2 BREACH. If either party hereto fails to (i) pay any amounts when due and payable hereunder, and such failure continues for a period of fifteen Business Days after written notice of such failure referring to this Section 3.2 is given to such party by the other party; (ii) comply with Section 4.3 and such failure continues for a period of fifteen days after written notice of such failure referring to this Section 3.2 is given by the other party, or (iii) observe or perform any of its other obligations under this Agreement and such failure continues for a period of thirty days after written notice of such failure referring to this Section 3.2 is given by the other party, then without prejudice to any other rights or remedies the other party may have, this Agreement may be terminated by the other party by notice to the defaulting party so long as such failure is still continuing at the time of giving such notice. 3.3 **** SPONSOR. If at any time LMGC permits Collectors to redeem AMRM earned from a **** Sponsor, or from **** as a conversion reward under the **** program operated by **** or any similar points conversion program hereafter introduced by ****, in either case for Airline Seats purchased hereunder at the Special Fares, Airline may notify LMGC thereof in writing referring to this Section 3.3 and demand that such practice cease. If such practice is still continuing 15 days after receipt by LMGC of such notice, Airline may terminate this Agreement on not less than 90 days written notice to LMGC, provided that such notice must be given no later than 90 days following the expiry of such 15 day period. In addition, LMGC agrees that, if at any time **** wishes to offer AMRM as a redemption option under any points conversion program which is promoted by reference to the fact that points earned thereunder can be redeemed for flights on Air Canada, LMGC shall use all reasonable efforts to persuade **** not to proceed therewith. Airline acknowledges, however, that LMGC may not have the right to force **** not to proceed with any such program and shall have no liability if **** does proceed therewith. 3.4 POSTTERMINATION RIGHTS. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the parties shall continue to be liable for all financial and other monetary obligations respectively incurred by each of them pursuant to this Agreement prior to such termination until the time each of such obligations shall have been fully satisfied, and exercise by either party of its right to terminate under any provision of this Agreement will not affect or impair its right to enforce its **** PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT. 8 other rights or remedies under this Agreement. All obligations of each party that have accrued before termination or that are of a continuing nature will survive termination. ARTICLE 4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND TRADEMARKS 4.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) Throughout the Term and for a period of 5 years following the termination of this Agreement, each party will, and will cause each of its Representatives (as defined below) to, hold in strictest confidence and not use in any manner whatsoever and only disclose to those of its Representatives who have a need to know same for purposes of this Agreement, any Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other party, whether provided before or after the date of this Agreement, including any Confidential Information provided by LMGC to Airline in connection with Airline's initial determination of whether to enter into this Agreement; provided that the foregoing will not apply (i) to use by LMGC of its data base; (ii) where disclosure of Confidential Information is required by law or in order to enforce rights under or in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof; (iii) where the Confidential Information which has been disclosed had already ceased to be confidential through no fault of the disclosing party or its Representatives; (iv) to disclosure by LMGC of any terms of this Agreement to its or its Affiliates' actual or prospective financiers or investors or otherwise in connection with a financing, including disclosing to any underwriter, potential purchasers of LMGC's or any of its Affiliate's shares or business and including their respective counsel, or (v) to disclosure by Airline to CAI, unless the CCAA Plan is not approved in which case Airline may not thereafter disclose Confidential Information of LMGC to CAI unless otherwise permitted hereunder.

"Representative" means, with respect to any party, any of its directors, officers or employees or outside auditors, lawyers or advertising or p.r. agencies, but for greater certainty, not any other outside consultants or agencies. (c) If any party is served with a subpoena or other legal process or other governmental request requiring the production or disclosure of any Confidential Information, or for any other reason believes that it is required by law to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party, then that party will, before complying, promptly notify the other party and use all reasonable efforts to permit the other party a reasonable period of time to intervene and contest disclosure or production, and will in any event use all reasonable efforts to ensure confidential treatment of such Confidential Information if so disclosed. 4.2 ANNOUNCEMENTS. Airline acknowledges that LMGC intends to issue a news release forthwith after execution hereof substantially in the form attached as Schedule F, and consents thereto. Subject thereto, neither party shall issue any news releases in respect of the entering into of this Agreement or the background thereto, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, but subject to the exceptions as to confidentiality set forth in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 4.1(a), throughout the Term (i) Airline will refrain, and will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that its Representatives (as defined in Section 4.1) refrain, from making statements to third parties, including the press or regulatory authorities, which denigrate or otherwise refer in an unfavourable manner to the Program or its features or the business relationship between the parties, or otherwise having discussions to such effect with any third parties, and (ii) LMGC will refrain, and will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that its Representatives (as defined in Section 4.1) refrain, from making statements to third parties, including the press, or regulatory authorities which denigrate or otherwise refer in an unfavourable manner to Airline or its business or the business relationship between the parties, or otherwise having discussions to such effect with any third parties. 4.3 TRADEMARKS. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein or as required by law, neither LMGC nor Airline shall use any logo or trademark of the other without the prior written permission of the other. In addition, during the Initial Period, LMGC may use the name "Air Canada" in advertising or promotional material for purposes of identifying to current, future or potential Collectors or Sponsors the availability of Airline Seats from Airline as a redemption option and subject to the following restrictions (which, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), shall not apply to displays on web sites): (i) the Air Canada name will not appear on the same page as the name of **** or ****, (ii) it will appear only together with the name of another supplier to the Program, and (iii) LMGC will not permit **** or **** to use such name in their marketing or promotional materials relating to the Program.

In consideration of such assignment and the price increases contemplated hereby for **** and ****, Airline shall pay to LMGC, within five Business Days following distribution or payment of any amounts in respect of the Claim, ****. Without limiting Section 6.2, Airline's obligation to pay such amount is absolute and unconditional and applies notwithstanding any of the matters referred to in Section 6.2. If Airline fails to pay such amount to LMGC when due, then, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies LMGC may have, LMGC may set off such amount against any amounts otherwise payable hereunder to Airline, and Airline shall pay interest to LMGC from the due date of such payment until such payment is made in full at **** per annum. ARTICLE 6 GENERAL 6.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
