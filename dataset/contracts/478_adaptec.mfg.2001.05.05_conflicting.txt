ARTICLE 18 DISPUTE RESOLUTION Resolution of any and all disputes arising from or in connection with this Agreement ("Disputes") shall be exclusively governed by and settled in accordance with the provisions of this Article 18. (a) The parties shall make a good faith attempt to resolve any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement through informal negotiation between appropriate representatives or each of Adaptec and Roxio. If at any time either party feels that such negotiations are not leading to a resolution of the Dispute, such party may send a notice to the other party describing the Dispute and requesting a meeting of the senior executives from each party. Within ten (10) business days after such notice of a Dispute is given, each party shall select appropriate senior executives (e.g. director or V.P. level) of each party who shall have the authority to resolve the matter and shall meet to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the Dispute prior to pursuing other available remedies. During the course of negotiations under this Section 18 (a), all reasonable requests made by one party to the other for information, including requests for copies of relevant documents, will be honored. The specific format for such negotiations 12 will be left to the discretion of the designated negotiating senior executives but may include the preparation of agreed upon statements of fact or written statements of position furnished to the other party. In the event that any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is not settled by the parties within thirty (30) days after the first meeting of the negotiating senior executives, either party may commence litigation with respect to the Dispute. However, except as provided below in Section 18 (b), neither party shall commence litigation against the other party to resolve the Dispute (i) until the parties try in good faith to settle the Dispute by negotiation for at least thirty (30) days after the first meeting of the negotiating senior executives, or (b) until forty (40) days after notice of a Dispute is given by either party to the other party, whichever occurs first. (b) Any Dispute regarding the following is not required to be negotiated prior to seeking relief from a court of competent jurisdiction: breach of any obligation of confidentiality; infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of any intellectual property right; or any other claim where interim relief from the court is sought to prevent serious and irreparable injury to a party. However, the parties to the Dispute shall make a good faith effort to negotiate such Dispute, according to the above procedures, while such court action is pending. ARTICLE 19 GENERAL 19.1 NOTICES.
