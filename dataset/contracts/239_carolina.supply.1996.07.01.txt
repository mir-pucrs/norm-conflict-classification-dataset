The description of the coal to be sold and delivered under this Agreement for use at Buyer's Roxboro 4 and/or Mayo 1 Units is made part of the basis of the bargain of the Agreement. Conformity to the description also requires that the coal be substantially free from impurities. The said coal shall not be larger than 2 inches in diameter, but may be of smaller size provided such smaller size does not cause Buyer unusual difficulties in handling and utilization. The said coal shall conform to the following quality characteristics: MONTHLY PURCHASE ORDER WEIGHTED TRAINLOAD AVERAGE SHIPMENT Moisture Content, % 8.5 max. 9.0 max. Ash Content, % 13.2 max. 14.0 max. Calorific Content, Btu/lb. 12,000 avg. (5) Sulfur Content, lbs. SO(2)/mm Btu(1) 1.2 max. 1.2 max. Volatile Matter %(2)(3) (6) 25.0 min. Grindability (HGI) 39 min. 38 min. Ash Fusion Temp. (H=W, Reducing)(degree)F(2)(4) (6) 2400 Min. (1) Pounds of SO(2)/mmBtu are predicated on the conversion of 100 percent of available sulfur to sulfur dioxide. (2) The specifications for Volatile Matter and Ash Fusion Temperature apply to deliveries from sources other than Marrowbone mines producing in the Coalburg, Clarion, and/or 5Block seams. (3) The minimum trainload specification for Volatile Matter shall be increased to 30.0% effective January 1, 2000. (4) No coal shall be shipped from a seam or source with an Ash Fusion Temperature below 2400(degree)F (H=W, Reducing). (5) No trainload maximum or minimum identified for this characteristic. (6) No monthly purchase order weighted average identified for Volatile Matter or Ash Fusion Temperature. 2.0 Quantity and Delivery. (a) Except as provided in Paragraph 8.0, Force Majeure, deliveries of coal under this Agreement commencing on July 1, 1996 and thereafter shall be as follows: YEAR TOTAL TONNAGE July thru December, 1996 1,375,000 tons 1997 and thereafter through 2006 2,750,000 tons per year TOTAL 28,875,000 tons 2 Buyer and Sellers understand and agree that the tonnages set forth above are annual commitments and that Buyer and Sellers shall schedule, ship and accept shipments each calendar month as necessary to insure that such annual contract commitments are satisfied each calendar year, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 8.0, Force Majeure. Monthly shipping schedules will, where possible, be adjusted to reflect Sellers' planned vacation period and Buyer's planned maintenance outages. (1) On or prior to December 1 of each calendar year during the term hereof, Sellers shall provide Buyer with a tentative schedule of monthly coal shipments during the ensuing calendar year. Buyer shall promptly review this schedule and notify Sellers of any modifications within ten (10) business days of receipt. Buyer and Sellers shall then agree on the tentative monthly shipping schedule for the ensuing calendar year on or prior to December 20. (2) Buyer shall specify to Sellers on or prior to the twentyfifth day of each calendar month during the term hereof the dates and destinations for shipments to be made hereunder in the next succeeding calendar month; provided, however, that Buyer reserves the right to change the destination of such shipments at any time. (b) The term "ton" as used herein shall mean a net ton of two thousand pounds, avoirdupois weight. (c) Sellers will load coal sold hereunder pursuant to trainload or other applicable tariffs (and supplements) established by the railroad that will haul the coal, and such other tariffs as may evolve that are mutually acceptable to Buyer, Sellers, and the railroad. Loading of trains at the rate of at least 10,000 tons in a 4hour period will be performed by Sellers, exclusive of holidays, in accordance with the provisions of applicable freight tariffs. (d) Buyer and Sellers shall mutually arrange for the necessary rail cars to make the specified deliveries and Sellers shall cause the coal to be loaded in a manner that will assure reasonably uniform consistency as to size and quality. Sellers shall cause each rail car to be loaded to full visible capacity, and shall reimburse Buyer for any penalty and freight charges resulting from deficits in carload minimum weight. Sellers shall pay any costs of demurrage or storage at the shipping points not caused by Buyer. (e) The coal shipped hereunder shall be supplied from the loadout facilities of Marrowbone or, at Sellers' sole discretion, any other source, provided that: 3 (1) With respect to shipments from Marrowbone, Sellers shall have the right, at their sole discretion, to purchase and/or process coals produced by other coal producers (whether affiliated with Sellers or not) and to ship such coal to Buyer, provided that the coal shipped to Buyer satisfies the quality characteristics specified in Paragraph 1.0, Description. (2) The f.o.b. mine prices set forth in Paragraph 5.0, Price are based on shipment from the Marrowbone loadout facility at Naugatuck, West Virginia. In the event Sellers elect to ship coal from any origin other than the Marrowbone loadout at Naugatuck, West Virginia, the f.o.b. mine place for such shipments shall be adjusted to result in the same delivered cost to Buyer, calculated in cents per million Btu, as the cost which would have resulted if such shipments had originated from Marrowbone. (3) With the exception of purchases of replacement coal for nonshipment arising out of force majeure events (as provided in Paragraph 8.0, Force Majeure), if Sellers elect to supply coal to Buyer from sources other than Marrowbone, such coal shall be purchased by Sellers under a contract with a coal producer with a term of at least sixty (60) days. Sellers shall notify Buyer before shipping any coal to Buyer from a source or seam other than those from which coal has been shipped to Buyer in the past hereunder. 2.1 Weights. (a) In the event that coal is delivered from the Marrowbone loadout at Naugatuck, West Virginia, Sellers will determine the weight of coal delivered under this Agreement by means of electronic belt scales located at the mine site, provided and operated by Sellers and approved by the railroad. The loaded weight will be determined for each train for each loading and such weight shall be the basis for payment by Buyers. Sellers shall test and calibrate such scales at thirty (30) day intervals to maintain them at a trainload accuracy within plus or minus 0.5 percent through the use of calibration techniques acceptable to Sellers, Buyer, and the railroad. Testing, calibration, and certification of the scales will be under the jurisdiction of the railroad and the applicable state agency. Sellers shall promptly provide Buyer with a copy of the results of all scale testing, calibrations, and certifications. (b) Sellers shall give immediate notice by telephone or facsimile, and confirm such notice in writing to both Buyer and the railroad, if and when Sellers discover that the weighing facilities have become inoperable or are discovered to be in error beyond the limits mentioned above. During any period when such weighing facilities are inoperable or in error, 4 determination of the quantities of coal delivered shall be made by a procedure to be established by Buyer, Sellers, and the railroad. (c) Buyer shall have the right to have a representative present at any and all times to observe the determination of weights. If Buyer should at any time question the accuracy of the weights thus determined, Buyer shall so advise Sellers, and confirm such advice in writing, and Sellers shall arrange to test the weighing devices or methods. If such tests show the weighing devices to be in error, they shall be adjusted to the required accuracy as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers, in accordance with generally accepted calibration techniques used in the coal and railroad industries. (d) If the weighing devices are determined to be in error beyond the limits as set forth in Paragraph 2.1(a), an appropriate adjustment shall be made in weights and related payments; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be retroactive for a period in excess of thirty (30) days prior to the date that Buyer first questioned Sellers about the accuracy of the weighing devices or methods, or thirty (30) days prior to the discovery of the inaccuracy of the weighing devices if the inaccuracy is discovered upon a regularly scheduled testing. (e) In the event Sellers elect to supply coal to Buyer from sources other than Marrowbone, the weight of coal in each shipment shall be determined in accordance with Buyer's transportation contract with the railroad, any amendments thereto, or any new agreements between Buyer and the railroad for the transportation of coal hereunder. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to weigh such coal at Seller's loading facilities as long as such weights are determined by scales and in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the railroad. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any and all costs associated with the weighing of such coal charged by the railroad to Buyer. Weights so determined shall be accepted by the parties for purposes of payment hereunder 3.0 Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for the period beginning October 1, 1976 and ending December 31, 2006. 4.0 Payment. Buyer shall make payments in accordance with the following schedule: (a) For coal received at Buyer's plants from the first day of the month through the fifteenth day of the month, payment will be made on or before the tenth day of the following month. (b) For coal received at Buyer's plants from the sixteenth day of the month through the last day of the month, payment will be made on or before the twentyfifth day of the following month. 5 (c) Payments for coal pursuant to Paragraph 5.3 will be made on or before the dates indicated therein. All payments shall be made by wire or electronic transfer of immediately available funds on the dates indicated, and shall be paid to Sellers at: Mountaineer Coal Development Company d/b/a Marrowbone Development Company c/o Bank of America 231 S. LaSalle Street Chicago, IL 60697 Account #7820151 ABA #071000039 5.0 Price. 5.1 The price per ton f.o.b. mine for all tons shipped on or near July 1, 1996 shall be as follows: CALENDAR YEAR ANNUAL PRICE 1996 (effective 7/1) $33.00 1997 $29.50 1998 $28.00 1999 $28.50 2000 $29.00 2001 $29.58 2002 $30.06 2003 $30.67 2004 $31.28 2005 $31.91 2006 $32.55 5.2 Buyer and Sellers recognize that the prices set forth in Paragraph 5.1 may require adjustment, either increase or decrease, because of the imposition of federal or state legislation or regulation after July 1, 1996, or any changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing federal or state requirements after 6 July 1, 1996, that impose or change a tax, assessment or other governmental charge based on the volume of tons produced or the price of coal sold by Sellers under this Agreement. In the event of such an imposition, either party may submit to the other party detailed documentation of the proposed price adjustment, and Sellers and Buyer shall meet to discuss and attempt to agree upon an adjustment to reflect the actual change in Sellers' costs. In the event that Sellers elect to supply coal from sources other than Marrowbone, the provisions of this Paragraph 5.2 shall only apply to the price of coal from such sources if (i) Sellers purchase such coal for resale to Buyer under a contract with a term of at least one (1) year, and (ii) the contract between Sellers and the supplier of such coal provides for the payment by Sellers to the supplier of the types of costs described in this Paragraph 5.2, including any such costs in effect at the time Sellers execute a contract for the purchase of coal from such sources. In the event that Sellers elect to blend coal subject to price adjustments pursuant to this Paragraph 5.2 with other coals, only the price for the percentage of such coal supplied to Sellers that is subject to this Paragraph 5.2 shall be adjusted. In the event Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree as to the amount the price per ton should be increased or decreased, then the matter shall be submitted to an independent third party experienced in the matters in question that is acceptable to both Sellers and Buyer. The cost of such third party shall be borne equally by Buyer and Sellers. The price increase or decrease per ton, as determined by the independent third party, shall be binding on both Sellers and Buyer; provided, however, that any increase shall not exceed the amount previously proposed by Sellers, and any decrease shall not exceed the amount previously proposed by Buyer. In the event a third party cannot be agreed upon, the provisions of Paragraph 18.0, Third Party Selection shall apply. 5.3 On the day of execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall remit a payment for coal of $3,013,000 to Sellers. Buyer shall remit the following additional payments for coal to Sellers on or before the dates specified: YEAR JANUARY 1 APRIL 1 JULY 1 OCTOBER 1 1996 $3,000,000 1997 $3,750,000 $3,750,000 $3,750,000 $3,750,000 1998 $4,625,000 $4,625,000 $4,625,000 $4,625,000 1999 $4,062,500 $4,062,500 $4,062,500 $4,062,500 7 6.0 Remedies for Quality Deviations. The following are Buyer's sole and exclusive remedies for coal quality deviations from the quality characteristics specified in Paragraph 1.0, Description: (a) A price adjustment shall be applied to Sellers' account when there is a difference between the asreceived Btu per pound and 12,000 Btu per pound. If and when the results of analysis reflect that the average Btu content of coal delivered hereunder, calculated on a per purchase order basis, is less than 11,900 or more than 12,100 Btu per pound, a price adjustment will be made based upon the delivered cost of coal to Buyer, including the actual freight rate per ton, excluding the payment for coal pursuant to Paragraph 5.3. EXAMPLE For coal delivered with a weighted average quality of 12,200 Btu per pound on a purchase order basis at a price per ton of $19.20 and a freight rate of $4.31 per ton, an increase in the price per ton would be calculated as follows: Price $19.20 Freight Rate 4.3l Delivered Cost/Ton $23.51 200 Btu/lb. Variance X $23.51 = $.3918/ton increase in the price per ton 12,000 Btu/lb. Guarantee For coal delivered with a weighted average quality of 11,800 Btu per pound on a purchase order basis at a price per ton of $19.20 and a freight rate of $4.31 per ton, a decrease in the price per ton would be calculated as follows: Price $19.20 Freight Rate 4.3l Delivered Cost/Ton $23.51 200 Btu/lb. Variance X $23.51 = $.3918/ton decrease in the price per ton 12,000 Btu/lb. Guarantee (b) Moisture Content (1) If the weighted average moisture content calculated on a per purchase order basis exceeds 8.5%, a price adjustment of $.20 per ton per percentage point (fractions pro rata) will be credited to Buyer for all tons shipped under that purchase order. (2) If the moisture content of any trainload shipment of coal exceeds 9.0%, a price adjustment of $.25 per ton will be credited to Buyer for all tons in such trainload shipment. 8 (c) Ash Content (1) If the weighted average ash content calculated on a per purchase order basis exceeds 13.2%, a price adjustment of $.30 per ton per percentage point (fractions pro rata) will be credited to Buyer for all tons shipped under that purchase order. (2) If the ash content of any trainload shipment of coal exceeds 14%, a price adjustment of $.40 per ton will be credited to Buyer for all tons in such trainload shipment. (d) Grindability (HGI) (1) If the weighted average grindability calculated on a per purchase order basis is less than 39, a price adjustment of $.25 per ton per grind point (fractions pro rata) will be credited to Buyer for all tons shipped under that purchase order. (2) If the grindability of any trainload shipment of coal is less than 38, a price adjustment of $.35 per ton will be credited to Buyer for all tons in such trainload shipment. (e) Sellers agree to promptly supply Buyer with an analysis, performed in accordance with ASTM standards, of the sulfur content of each shipment of coal supplied under this Agreement. In the event that the sulfur content of any single trainload shipment exceeds 1.2 lbs. SO(2)/mmBtu, Buyer shall have the right to reject such trainload shipment, and title and risk of loss shall revert back to Sellers upon rejection. In the event that a trainload shipment of coal is rejected by Buyer, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for its actual costs incurred including transportation from the mine to destination. Buyer shall not unload any trainload shipment delivered hereunder until it has received Sellers' analysis reflecting a sulfur content of 1.2 pounds SO(2)/mmBtu or less. Sellers agree to reimburse Buyer for any demurrage incurred as a result of holding any trainload shipment while awaiting receipt of such analysis. (f) In the event that Sellers are supplying coal hereunder from a source other than Marrowbone mines producing coal in the Coalburg, Clarion and/or 5Block seams and the analysis of any trainload shipment containing any coal from such source indicates an Ash Fusion Temperature (H=W, Reducing) less than 2400(degree)F or a Volatile Matter content of less than 25.0% (30% effective January 1, 2000), Buyer may suspend further shipments from such source until Sellers give Buyer reasonable assurances that further shipments from such source will satisfy the requirements of Paragraph 1.0, Description. For the purpose of this Paragraph 6.0(f), a source shall be defined as an individual mine or a readily identifiable seam for which quality is ascertainable, and from which coal is produced for 9 delivery hereunder. Any trainload shipments containing any coal from such source that have an Ash Fusion Temperature (H=W, Reducing) less than 2400(degree)F or a Volatile Matter content of less than 25.0% (30% effective January l, 2000) that have not yet been unloaded may be rejected by Buyer, and upon rejection, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for its actual costs incurred including transportation from the mine to destination, and title and risk of loss shall revert to Sellers. In the event that shipments hereunder originate at any Marrowbone mine producing coal in the Coalburg, Clarion, and/or 5Block seams, Buyer shall not have the right to suspend or reject shipments based on the Ash Fusion Temperature or Volatile Matter content of such shipments. 6.1 Other Quality Parameters. In the event Buyer is unable, after exerting reasonable efforts, to burn coal shipped hereunder from reserves other than the Coalburg, Clarion and/or 5Block seam reserves controlled by Marrowbone as of July 1, 1996 because such coal causes significant operating problems that are directly attributable to a quality parameter other than those set forth in Paragraph 1.0, Description, Buyer shall consult with Sellers, and allow Sellers' combustion consultants reasonable access to Buyer's records, facilities, and personnel, in an effort to alleviate such problems. In the event the parties' efforts do not alleviate such operating problems within fortyfive (45) days from Buyer's notification to Sellers of the problem, Sellers shall, at their sole discretion, elect either (i) to change to a source that Sellers, after reasonable consultation with Buyer, determine will alleviate such operating problems, in which case shipments will commence as soon as practicable from such changed source and any shipments missed as a result of Buyer's operating problems or the change in source shall be made up as soon as practicable, or (ii) to cease shipments hereunder for the remaining term of the contract or commitment for the source that Sellers and Buyer believe is causing such operating problems. Buyer's operating problems, and Sellers' election of either of the foregoing options, shall not excuse or otherwise effect Buyer's obligation to make payments for coal pursuant to Paragraph 5.3. Upon request by Sellers, Buyer shall evaluate any source or seam of coal to be supplied under this Agreement, and if such source or seam is approved by Buyer, in writing, in advance of the commencement of shipments from such source or seam, the provisions of this Paragraph 6.1 shall not apply. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Buyer shall not withhold such approval if it has previously purchased coal from the source or seam in question and burned such coal without encountering significant operating problems. Sellers shall provide Buyer with quality information regarding the seam or source. In the event Buyer has not burned coal from the source or seam in question, Buyer may test burn such coal. If Sellers request a test, Buyer shall test burn such coal unless the quality information provided to Buyer indicates that there is a quality characteristic inherent in the coal, other than those specified in Paragraph 1.0, Description, which prevents the burning of such coal at Roxboro 4 and/or Mayo 1 10 Units. The coal supplied for such test will be supplied at a mutually agreedupon price, consistent with the spot market price for compliance coal at the time of the shipment. The quantity of coal supplied for the test burn shall not exceed 50,000 tons, and such quantity will be in addition to the tonnage commitment pursuant to Paragraph 2.0, Quantity and Delivery. Buyer shall inform Sellers of its decision to approve or disapprove such source or seam within ten (10) days of receipt of all necessary information and/or completion of any test burn of the coal. 7.0 Sampling and Analysis. Sellers or their designee shall sample and analyze each trainload shipment of coal to be delivered to Buyer to determine the quality parameters specified in Paragraph 1.0, Description. Such sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with ASTM standards or by other mutually acceptable methods. Sampling of the coal will be performed as the coal is loaded into railcars. Sellers or their designee shall provide trainload analyses to Buyer as soon as practicable after each train is loaded. 7.1 Buyer or its representative shall have the right to inspect the sampling system(s) and laboratory used to sample and analyze the coal applied hereunder at any and all times that coal is loaded or analyzed for delivery to Buyer. Should it be determined that the sampling system(s) or laboratory are not in compliance with ASTM standards for sampling and analyzing coal, Sellers agree to take the necessary steps to ensure that future shipments of coal to Buyer are sampled and analyzed in accordance with ASTM standards. Prior to or within ten (10) days of the first shipment of coal that is sampled or analyzed by a sampling system or laboratory that has not previously sampled or analyzed deliveries under this Agreement, Sellers shall provide Buyer with independent confirmation that the sampling system and/or the laboratory are in accordance with ASTM standards. 7.2 Should it be determined that sampling or analysis of a trainload shipment was not performed by Sellers or their designee in accordance with ASTM standards, the parties agree that (i) Buyer's sampling and analysis shall govern for that shipment or (ii) if neither party performed the sampling and analysis of that shipment in accordance with ASTM standards, the shipment shall be deemed not to have been sampled and analyzed for the purposes of this Agreement. The sampling and analysis of a shipment that was performed in accordance with ASTM standards and that was used in calculating adjustments to monthly billings in accordance with Paragraph 6.0, Remedies for Quality Deviations herein shall govern for all other purposes under this Agreement. 7.3 As soon as practicable after the end of each month, the weighted average quality of the coal delivered hereunder for the quality parameters specified in Paragraph 1.0, Description hereof during that month shall be determined on a purchase order basis and provided to Buyer. The quality results thus determined shall be used in calculating price adjustments pursuant to Paragraph 6.0, Remedies for Quality Deviations. 11 7.4 In the event that Sellers elect to ship coal from source(s) other than Marrowbone pursuant to Paragraph 2.0(e) that will deliver coal directly to Buyer under a purchase agreement with a term of one year or more, or volume of 500,000 tons or more, Buyer shall promptly review the independent confirmation that the sampling system is in accordance with ASTM standards pursuant to Paragraph 7.1. If the subject sampling system has been changed since its last bias test, or has not been bias tested within the last eighteen (18) months, and Buyer has reasonable concerns regarding possible bias of such system, Buyer shall have the right to request a bias test of the sampling system, to be conducted within sixty (60) days of commencement of shipments from such source, by an independent third party in conformance with the Rose method for bias testing. A report of the test will be supplied to Buyer and Sellers. Should the results of the bias test show a "statistically significant bias" in the sampling system as determined by the third party, Sellers shall take immediate action to eliminate such bias, and shall pay for all costs of the bias test. If the bias test does not show a "statistically significant bias" in the sampling system, Buyer shall pay for all reasonable costs of the bias test. In the event the third party called for above cannot be agreed upon, the provisions of Paragraph 18.0, Third Party Selection shall apply. 8.0 Force Majeure 8.1 Neither party shall be subject to liability to the other for failure to perform in strict compliance with this Agreement where such failure results from an event or occurrence beyond the control of the party affected thereby such as, without limitation, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, strikes, labor disputes, labor and material shortages, fires, explosions, floods, breakdowns or damage to the mines, plants, equipment or facilities, interruptions to transportation, car shortages, embargoes, orders or acts of civil or military authority, legislation, regulation, or administrative ruling. Normally scheduled maintenance outages, including without limitation outages for installation of equipment (including any outage for the installation of low NOx burners at the Roxboro 4 Unit) required to comply with regulations or legislation in effect as of July 1, 1996, shall not constitute an event of force majeure hereunder. Written notice including full information as to the cause and probable extent of the event shall be furnished within ten (10) calendar days after the failure first occurs. Failure to provide such notice within the ten (10) calendar days specified herein shall be deemed a waiver of all rights provided pursuant to Paragraph 8.1 with regard to the particular event or occurrence. Any interruption in deliveries hereunder as a result of any such force majeure event shall not terminate this Agreement and upon removal of the cause of interruption, deliveries shall be resumed. 8.2 In the event of the enactment of any federal, state or local law, legislation, ordinance, rule or regulation after July 1, 1996, which prohibits the burning or use of the coal to be supplied hereunder or has the effect of requiring Buyer to purchase coal having different quality characteristics from those set forth in Paragraph 1.0, Description in order to comply with such federal, state or local law, ordinance or regulation, shipments hereunder may be terminated by Buyer 12 upon ninety (90) days advance notice to Sellers; provided, however, that shipments under this Agreement shall not be so canceled if Sellers elect (i) to substitute coal from other sources and such coal has quality characteristics which enable Buyer to comply with applicable law, or (ii) to modify the operation from which the coal is supplied such that the quality of coal shipped shall enable Buyer to comply with applicable law, or (iii) to take any other step that enables Buyer to comply with applicable law. In the event that shipments are terminated pursuant to this Paragraph 8.2, Buyer shall remit to Sellers $3.447 per ton as liquidated damages as full and complete settlement of all claims and not as a penalty for each ton terminated. Such amounts shall be paid in accordance with Paragraph 4.0, Payment based upon the shipment schedule established pursuant to Paragraph 2.0, Quantity and Delivery. Termination of shipments pursuant to this Paragraph 8.2 shall excuse Buyer's obligation to make payments for coal pursuant to Paragraph 5.3 with respect to those tons terminated. To the extent that such payments for coal have been made by Buyer with respect to terminated tons, such amounts shall be credited against future payments for coal to be made under Paragraph 5.3, or if no future payments for coal are to be made, Sellers shall refund such amounts to Buyer. 8.3 In the event that (i) a force majeure event results in the physical inability to generate electricity at the Roxboro 4 and/or Mayo 1 Unit(s), or (ii) a force majeure event that does not fall within Paragraph 8.2 above totally prevents the generation of electricity at Roxboro 4 and/or Mayo 1, for a period that exceeds six (6) consecutive calendar months in duration ("Extended Force Majeure"), Buyer's annual commitment to purchase coal under this Agreement shall be reduced by an amount equal to the number of tons not shipped during and as a result of the Extended Force Majaure; provided, however, that nothing herein shall (or shall be construed to) discharge or diminish Buyer's obligation to take reasonable steps to avoid, cure, or otherwise mitigate the effect of such an event of force majeure, including but not limited to acceptance of additional quantities hereunder at the unaffected Unit. Buyer shall not enter into any new spot or contract agreements for compliance coal for the unaffected Unit during the term of the Extended Force Majeure until Sellers are given the option to supply such quantities hereunder. Should Buyer expect that the Extended Force Majeure will exceed a total of twelve (12) months, then after the expiration of the initial six (6) months of the Extended Force Majeure, the parties shall determine whether the coal to be delivered hereunder or coal with different specifications than those in Paragraph 1.0, Description can be supplied by Sellers and consumed at Buyer's other coalfired plants without causing operational problems, regulatory compliance issues, or breach of any contract commitments to other coal suppliers. If so, Sellers shall have the option to deliver such coal under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be amended to reflect any necessary changes. If coal with different specifications than those in Paragraph 1.0, Description is delivered hereunder, the price for such coal shall be adjusted to reflect the difference in the quality of the coal to be substituted and any other relevant factors in existence at the time. Should the parties be unable to agree upon such an adjustment, it shall 13 be determined by an independent third party agreed upon by both Buyer and Sellers. In the event a third party cannot be agreed upon, the provisions of Paragraph 18.0, Third Party Selection shall apply. The occurrence of an Extended Force Majeure shall not affect Buyer's obligation to make payments for coal as set forth in Paragraph 5.3. 8.4 Coal not shipped as scheduled as a result of an event of force majeure (excluding coal not shipped due to an Extended Force Majeure pursuant to Paragraph 8.3) shall be rescheduled for shipment as soon as practicable after the cessation of the force majeure event. This revised schedule shall provide for delivery of such coal within thirty (30) months of cessation of the force majeure event. In the event that Sellers experience a force majeure event, the price applicable to rescheduled shipments shall be the lesser of the price applicable at the time such shipments were originally scheduled for shipment or the price applicable on the date of shipment of coal. In the event that Buyer experiences a force majeure event, the price applicable to such rescheduled shipments shall be the greater of the price in effect on the date of the shipment of the coal or the price applicable at the time such shipments were originally scheduled for shipment. 8.5 Except as provided in Paragraph 8.8, a force majeure event, including an Extended Force Majeure event pursuant to Paragraph 8.3, shall not affect the amount or timing of payments for coal due pursuant to Paragraph 5.3. Such payments for coal shall be made as if those tons not shipped as originally scheduled as a result of the force majeure event were shipped as so scheduled; provided, however, that if such tons are not made up pursuant to Paragraph 8.4 as a result of Sellers' inability to supply such tons, Buyer shall receive a credit for payments for coal made pursuant to Paragraph 5.3 with respect to any tons not shipped. 8.6 Twelve (12) months prior to any renewal of a contract between the United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA") and the employers of employees represented by the UMWA, or any future labor organization representing such employees, reasonable efforts shall be made by Buyer and Sellers to mutually agree to accelerate shipment of coal prior to the anticipated commencement of the expiration of such contract. Such acceleration of coal shipments (hereafter referred to as "Accelerated Tonnage"), which shall be shipped to Buyer and shall meet the specifications herein, is in anticipation of the interruption of coal supplies which might result by reason of the expiration of such contract. The price for all Accelerated Tonnage shall be the price in effect at the time the coal was originally scheduled to be shipped pursuant to Paragraph 5.1. Neither the amount nor the timing of the payments for coal due under Paragraph 5.3 with respect to such tons shall be affected by such acceleration and such payments for coal shall be made as if shipment of the Accelerated Tonnage had not occurred. 14 8.7 The parties shall mutually determine within thirty (30) days of the end of any disruption described in Paragraph 8.6 or any disruption resulting from a railroad labor strike, the amount of coal that Sellers were unable to ship based upon the tons scheduled to be shipped during the period of such disruption, less any Accelerated Tonnage.

We have agreed that simultaneously with the execution of this letter agreement the parties will execute, acknowledge and deliver the attached Amendment No. Three to the Marrowbone Contract which effectively reduces the tonnage requirement thereunder to 1.5 million tons per year through the remainder of the contract. In connection therewith, upon execution of the Amendment the following actions will be taken: 1. Horizon will immediately file in its bankruptcy proceeding appropriate Motions for the assumption of the Marrowbone Contract and the Coal Supply Agreement, dated December 29, 2000, between Horizon Natural Resources Sales Company, f/k/a AEI Coal Sales Company, Inc., and Massey Coal Sales Company, Inc., d/b/a Massey Utility Sales Company (the "Massey Contract"). In addition, Horizon will request an expedited review and approval of this assumption of executory contracts. 2. Horizon will immediately file a notice of rejection of the Franklin Contract under the procedures previously adopted for rejection of executory contracts in its bankruptcy proceeding. At such time as a nonappealable Order approving the assumption of the Marrowbone Contract and the Massey Contract has been entered by the Bankruptcy Court, Horizon will execute and deliver to CP&L a letter of confirmation in the form attached whereby Horizon (i) dedicates the coal to be received under the assumed Massey Contract for fulfillment of its obligations under the Marrowbone Contract, as amended and assumed; and (ii) covenants and Mr. Dwain K. Lanier Executive Director, Fossil Fuels Progress EnergyCarolinas, Inc. July 28, 2003 Page 2 agrees that it will not transfer or assign the Massey Contract without the prior written consent of CP&L. We acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this agreement is intended to be a waiver or release of any outstanding claims or disputes relating to light loading charges imposed by the Norfolk Southern Railroad and Horizon agrees to accept such ultimate responsibility as may be determined to exist pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Marrowbone Contract. Horizon and CP&L shall work together in a good faith effort to determine a reasonable light loading claim amount and resolve this matter within 90 days of the date hereof. If the foregoing properly reflects our agreement with respect to these matters, please so indicate by signing and dating this letter in the space provided below and return it together with an executed Amendment No. Three to me at your earliest convenience. This agreement may be executed via facsimile and in counterparts, each of which, when taken together, shall constitute an original.
