Section 4.06 Inability to Supply. If the Producer is unable despite best efforts to supply KBI or a Subsequent Producer with its requirements of any Product (or Intermediate Form thereof) for any reason, including without limitation an Event of Force Majeure, the Producer shall promptly notify KBI, each Subsequent Producer of that Product and TR and KB of such inability and of the date such inability is expected to end, and KBI shall (without affecting any right of recourse which KBI or such Subsequent Producer may have if the Producer's inability does not result from an Event of Force Majeure) offer to KB (if TR or an Alternate Producer is the Producer) or TR (if KB or KB USA is the Producer), as the case may be, the option to assume (with the right to appoint one or more subcontractors that may or may not be Non 24 30 Affiliates), from and after the date of such notice, all or any part of the manufacturing responsibilities previously allocated to the Producer who is unable to supply such requirements (the "NonPerforming Producer") with the Transfer Price therefor to be determined in accordance with Exhibit III or Exhibit IVA and Exhibit IVB, as applicable; provided, however, that TR shall not have the option to assume such responsibilities with respect to any Turbuhaler systems incorporating Products. KB shall promptly upon request deliver to TR (if TR assumes manufacturing responsibilities previously allocated to KB) such information relating to the Manufacturing Stage or Stages for which such Producer shall be responsible as KB is otherwise obligated to provide to a Producer pursuant to Article VII hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, KB shall not be obligated to provide any information to KBI or TR with respect to any Manufacturing Stage or Stages of a KB Pipeline Product to the extent KB is responsible for such Manufacturing Stage or Stages, except as set forth in Section 9.02. If neither KB nor TR, as the case may be, exercises the option to assume the manufacturing responsibilities of the NonPerforming Producer, KBI may decide to manufacture, have manufactured or obtain from any supplier, any or all of its requirements for such Product (or Intermediate Form). Within 90 days of notice from the NonPerforming Producer that it is able to resume the supply of KBI's or the Subsequent Producer's requirements for such Product (or Intermediate Form), KBI or such Subsequent Producer, as the case may be, shall resume obtaining all of its requirements of such Product (or Intermediate Form) from such NonPerforming Producer, subject to any commitments of KBI or such Subsequent Producer to suppliers for a period not extending more than 12 months beyond the date of the notice referred to in this sentence and KBI's or such Subsequent Producer's use of its existing inventories, if any. Section 4.07 Modification of Specifications and C & M Data. The Parties hereby agree, and KBI shall cause the Partnership to agree, that: (a) The Specifications and C & M Data for any Product shall be amended or supplemented to comply with applicable laws and regulations from time to time in effect in the Territory and may be amended or supplemented with the approval of the Producer, the Partnership and KB, which approval, if requested by such Producer, KB or the Partnership, shall not be unreasonably withheld by the others; provided, however, in the case of the Partnership, KBI shall cause the Partnership not to unreasonably withhold such approval. (b) In the event of any change in the Specifications or C & M Data for any Product, KBI shall require the Partnership to (x) amend the NDA for such Product, if required, to reflect such change, (y) use best efforts to obtain any required FDA approval of such amended NDA, and (z) if the change is requested by a Party other than the Producer or is required by the FDA or by law, reimburse the Producer for costs actually incurred by the Producer (or any of its Affiliates) in connection with such change, including without limitation onetime development costs specifically related to such change, costs of obsolescence of raw materials, goodsinprocess, packaging materials and supplies, and finished goods, which shall be valued at Product Cost, except that finished goods inventory will be valued at the Transfer Price otherwise applicable herein, unless, in the case of Products (or Intermediate Forms thereof) for which the Transfer Price is determined in accordance with Exhibit III or Exhibit IVA and Exhibit IVB, such costs are included in the computation of the Transfer Price pursuant to such exhibit; 25 31 provided, however, that such raw materials, goodsinprocess, materials, supplies and finished goods are not suitable, in the Producer's reasonable judgment, for use in the business or operations of the Producer (or any of its Affiliates); provided, however, that the inventory levels of such items shall be limited to those which are customary generally for the Producer's pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. This right of reimbursement shall apply to each Producer of a Product regardless of whether such Producer sells and delivers Product to KBI or sells and delivers Intermediate Forms to another Producer. Section 4.08 Manufacture by TR or an Alternate Producer Outside the Territory. (a) While TR intends to manufacture InLine Products within the Territory, if in TR's reasonable judgment it becomes economically advantageous to manufacture an InLine Product outside the Territory (either directly or through its Affiliates or subcontractors), TR may do so with KB's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld taking into consideration including, without limitation, KB's (and its Affiliates') existing and contemplated arrangements with its NonAffiliates with respect to manufacturing and marketing such InLine Product in the particular country outside the Territory. If such consent is given, KB shall, to the extent required, as contemplated by the KBI License, grant (and shall cause its Affiliates to grant) to TR a nonexclusive license to manufacture such InLine Product in such country for the sole purpose of satisfying TR's obligations under this Agreement, it being understood that such consent will not imply that KB has any rights under any patents or other intellectual property of any NonAffiliates of KB. (b) If TR wishes to manufacture (either directly or through its Affiliates or subcontractors) outside the Territory any KB Pipeline Product for which it has manufacturing responsibility for the Bulk Chemical or the Formulation Manufacturing Stage for such KB Pipeline Product, TR may do so with KB's consent, which consent shall not be withheld unless such manufacture would be prohibited by applicable law or by an existing agreement between KB (or any of its Affiliates) and a NonAffiliate of KB. If KB withholds its consent as set forth in this paragraph (b), either or both of KBI or TR may require that a copy of such agreement be delivered to a law firm designated by TR solely for purposes of confirming whether the terms of such agreement prohibit KB from consenting to TR's wishes to manufacture outside the Territory. If such consent is given, KB shall, to the extent required, as contemplated by the KBI License, grant (and shall cause its Affiliates to grant) to TR (or such Affiliate or subcontractor) a nonexclusive license to manufacture such KB Pipeline Product in such country for the sole purpose of satisfying TR's obligations under this Agreement, it being understood that such consent will not imply that KB has any rights under any patents or other intellectual property of any NonAffiliates of KB. (c) If any Alternate Producer wishes to manufacture (either directly or through its Affiliates or subcontractors) outside the Territory any KB Pipeline Product for which it has manufacturing responsibility for the Bulk Chemical or the Formulation Manufacturing Stage for such KB Pipeline Product, such Alternate Producer may do so with KB's consent, which consent shall not be withheld unless such manufacture would be prohibited by applicable law or by an existing agreement between KB (or any of its Affiliates) and a NonAffiliate of KB. If KB withholds its consent as set forth in this paragraph (c), KBI may require that a copy of such 26 32 agreement be delivered to a law firm designated by KBI solely for purposes of confirming whether the terms of such agreement prohibit KB from consenting to such Alternate Producer's wishes to manufacture outside the Territory. If such consent is given, KB shall, to the extent required, as contemplated by the KBI License, grant (and shall cause its Affiliates to grant) to any such Alternate Producer (or such Affiliate or subcontractor) a nonexclusive license to manufacture such KB Pipeline Product in such country for the sole purpose of satisfying such Alternate Producer's obligations under this Agreement, it being understood that such consent will not imply that KB has any rights under any patents or other intellectual property of any NonAffiliates of KB. (d) If KBI wishes to arrange for the toll manufacture (either directly or through its Affiliates or subcontractors) of the Packaging Manufacturing Stage of any KB Pipeline Product outside the Territory, KBI may do so with KB's consent, given in KB's sole discretion. If such consent is given, KB shall, to the extent required, as contemplated by the KBI License, grant (and shall cause its Affiliates to grant) to KBI a nonexclusive license to manufacture such KB Pipeline Product in such country for the sole purpose of satisfying its obligations under this Agreement, it being understood that such consent will not imply that KB has any rights under any patents or other intellectual property of any NonAffiliate of KB. (e) If the agreements referred to in paragraphs (b) or (c) above are delivered to a law firm designated by TR or KBI, as the case may be, TR or KBI, as the case may be, shall cause such law firm designated by it pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) not to disclose to TR or to KBI (or any of their respective Affiliates), as the case may be, the agreements received by said law firm pursuant to said paragraphs and not to disclose the information contained therein other than such information that is reasonably necessary for purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Section 4.09 Manufacture by KB Inside or Outside the Territory. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, (i) neither KB nor any of its Affiliates or subcontractors shall perform in the Territory any Manufacturing Stage (other than toll Packaging by KB USA (or any of its Affiliates) as the Producer for the Packaging Manufacturing Stage pursuant to Section 3.01(d)) with respect to any Product without the prior written consent of KBIE, as contemplated by the KBI Sublicense, which consent may be given or withheld in KBIE's sole discretion, and (ii) neither KB USA nor any of its subcontractors may perform the Packaging Manufacturing Stage with respect to any Product outside the Territory without the prior written consent of KBIE as contemplated by the KBI Sublicense, which consent may be given or withheld in KBIE's sole discretion; provided, however, that KB (and its Affiliates) may continue to perform any Manufacturing Stage in the Territory with respect to an Acquired Compound. Section 4.10 Manufacturing Sites. Subject to Sections 2.01(a), 3.01(d) and 4.09, each Producer shall in good faith apply such manufacturing, financial and other criteria in the selection of a manufacturing Site for each Manufacturing Stage for which it is a Producer as are applied by such Producer in the selection of manufacturing Sites for its own products. 27 33 Section 4.11 Termination Materials. If this Agreement shall terminate with respect to a Producer for any reason in its entirety or in respect of any Product (or Intermediate Form thereof), or in the event the Partnership should otherwise decide to discontinue the sale of, or not to launch, any Product, the Producer of such Product shall, as soon as practicable after the date of termination or after notice from KBI or the Partnership of the Partnership's decision to discontinue the sale of, or not to launch, such Product, sell and deliver to KBI or to such location as KBI may reasonably designate, and KBI shall purchase and accept from such Producer, such raw materials, goodsinprocess, packaging materials and supplies, reworkable finished goods and finished Products (or completed Intermediate Forms), which are specifically intended for use in the manufacture of the terminated Product or Products or for use in meeting KBI's requirements of such terminated Product or Products, are in such Producer's (or any of its Affiliates' or subcontractors') possession on the date of termination and are not suitable, in such Producer's reasonable judgment, for use in the business or operations of such Producer (or any of its Affiliates) by such Producer (or any of its Affiliates or subcontractors) (collectively, the "Termination Materials"); provided, however, that the inventory levels of such Termination Materials shall be limited to those which are customary generally for such Producer's (and its Affiliates') pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. Alternatively, KBI may instruct such Producer to dispose of Termination Materials in an appropriate manner, and KBI shall reimburse such Producer for the costs of such disposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Partnership decide not to launch or to discontinue the sale of any Product due to a default by a Producer, KBI or its designee shall purchase and accept from such Producer only such Termination Materials as KBI can reasonably be expected to use in its business and operations and KBI shall not be obligated to reimburse such Producer for disposal costs with respect to any Termination Materials. All Termination Materials shall be in good and marketable condition, in conformance, to the extent applicable, with the Specifications and C & M Data, and free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, security interests and the like. Payment for the Termination Materials in an amount equal to their cost to the Producer (and its Affiliates), which shall be valued at Product Cost, except that Bulk Chemical, Finished Dosage Form and finished goods inventory at the time of such termination will be valued at the Transfer Price otherwise applicable herein, shall be made by KBI in accordance with Section 5.05 concurrently with the acceptance of such Termination Materials by KBI. ARTICLE V TRANSFER PRICE, OTHER CHARGES AND PAYMENT Section 5.01 Transfer Price. The Transfer Price for each Product (or for the applicable Intermediate Form thereof) shall be determined as set forth in this Section 5.01. (a) InLine Products Sold in 1998 2000.

Section 5.02 Exclusion of InterAffiliate MarkUps and Profits. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, including Exhibit III, the Transfer Price computed in accordance with Exhibit III or Exhibit IVA and Exhibit IVB shall at all times exclude interAffiliate markups and interAffiliate profits. Section 5.03 Minimum Capital Charge. (a) To the extent that a Minimum Capital Charge is payable pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(vii), KBI shall pay KB or TR, to the extent that KB or TR is a Producer, and, may pay an Alternate Producer, the Minimum Capital Charge. Such Minimum Capital Charge shall be included in the Cost of Capital component of the Exhibit III or Exhibit IVA or IVB Transfer Price commencing on the projected Transition Date of the Product as KBI is notified by the Partnership, through the expiration of Market Exclusivity for the Product. (b) If there are no purchases of such Product in any one Year during the period beginning on the projected Transition Date and ending on the expiration of the period of Market Exclusivity as the Partnership notifies KBI pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the KBI Supply Agreement, then KBI shall pay to such Producer the Minimum Capital Charge for each month in such Year (with interest at an annual rate of 22% through the date of payment) regardless of the fact that no Transfer Price is paid for such Product during such Year. (c) If this Agreement shall terminate in its entirety or in respect of any Product to which a Minimum Capital Charge applies, or in the event the Partnership should otherwise decide not to launch or to discontinue the sale of any Product as to which a Minimum 30 36 Capital Charge applies, and the Partnership so notifies KBI pursuant to Section 3.08(b) of the KBI Supply Agreement, KBI shall pay to the Producer performing the Manufacturing Stage for such Product as to which a Minimum Capital Charge applies the Unrecovered Capitalized Amount for such Product. Such payment shall be made within one month after the month in which such notice was given. Any Minimum Capital Charge payable pursuant to Section 5.03(a) or (b) and applicable to such Product shall terminate at the time of such payment. Section 5.04 Invoices, Time of Payment and YearEnd Adjustments. (a) Payment by KBI to a Producer performing the Formulation Manufacturing Stage for a Product or the Bulk Chemical Manufacturing Stage for a Special Combination Product shall be made by KBI in accordance with Section 5.05 within 45 days after the date of the invoice therefor. Each Producer performing such Manufacturing Stage shall provide to KBI a copy of the related certificate of analysis as provided in Section 9.06. Payment by a Subsequent Producer to an Earlier Stage Producer performing the Bulk Chemical Manufacturing Stage shall be made by such Subsequent Producer in accordance with Section 5.05 within 45 days after the date of such Earlier Stage Producer's invoice therefor. Each Earlier Stage Producer shall provide to KBI a copy of its invoice to such Subsequent Producer.

Such invoices from an Earlier Stage Producer to a Subsequent Producer shall not include amounts to be borne by KBI pursuant to Sections 4.07 and 4.11 or any other provision hereof. As used in this Agreement, the Amount Attributable to Bulk Chemical means, with respect to a Product or Intermediate Form for which the Transfer Price is based on a Bid Price established pursuant to the Bid Procedure, the amount chargeable in the Transfer Price for such Product or Intermediate Form in respect of Bulk Chemical (including, if the Bulk Chemical Producer is the same as the Formulator, the amount chargeable under Exhibit III or Exhibit IVA and Exhibit IVB or under the Bid Procedure, as applicable, in respect of the amount of Bulk Chemical) incorporated in the Finished Dosage Form, in each case based on the estimated unitized price or the Bid Price. The Amount Attributable to Bulk Chemical shall be computed as follows: 31 37 AABC = Bulk Chemical Value x (1 / (1 Yield Loss Allowance)) where: AABC = The Amount Attributable to Bulk Chemical Bulk Chemical Value = Unitized value of the amount of Bulk Chemical incorporated in the Finished Dosage Form Yield Loss Allowance = The yield loss allowance specified in the Request for Bids for such Product, expressed as a decimal fraction rather than as a percentage (b) Payment for toll manufacturing by KBI to the Producer performing Packaging shall be made by KBI in accordance with Section 5.05 within 45 days after the date of such Producer's invoice therefor. Such invoice shall be based on the agreed terms of such toll manufacturing. Such invoices shall not include amounts to be borne by KBI pursuant to Sections 4.07 and 4.11 or any other provision hereof. Such invoice shall be accompanied by the related certificate of analysis as provided in Section 9.06. (c) In the event of any dispute between KBI and a Producer regarding a Transfer Price or any other amount charged by such Producer to a Subsequent Producer and paid by such Subsequent Producer, KBI shall remain obligated to pay all amounts invoiced pursuant to Section 5.04(b) (except the Transfer Price with respect to Packaging if the disputed amount is such Transfer Price), and KBI shall indemnify and hold each other Producer harmless against any Losses incurred in connection with such dispute or the matters giving rise to such dispute. (d) All amounts to be borne by KBI pursuant to Sections 4.07 and 4.11 or any other provision hereof shall be submitted directly to KBI in a separate invoice by the relevant Producer and KBI shall pay such amounts directly to such Producer in accordance with Section 5.05 within 45 days after the date of such Producer's invoice therefor. (e) As provided in Exhibit III and Exhibits IVA and IVB, certain components of the Transfer Price computed in accordance with such exhibits shall be adjusted within 90 days after the end of each Year, and as provided in the Bid Procedure, the Bid Prices paid to a Producer pursuant to the Bid Procedure (if such Producer has submitted the winning bid) may not exceed the amounts that would have been payable under Exhibit III or Exhibit IVA and IVB, as applicable, net of the amount paid to an Earlier Stage Producer. The applicable Producer or KBI, as the case may be, shall within 45 days after such adjustment pay directly to the other in accordance with Section 5.05 the amount required by such adjustments. 32 38 (f) In the event any payment required to be made pursuant to this Agreement is paid after the date due herein, the Producer or KBI, as the case may be, shall pay to the counterparty interest on the amount overdue calculated at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of 110% of the prime rate of interest (or its equivalent) charged by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, in New York, New York from time to time, or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, from the date such payment became due until it is paid in full. Section 5.05 Manner of Payment. All payments to TR or KBI shall be made by wire transfer to a bank account designated by TR at least four (4) business days prior to the date of payment. All payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement to KB or KB USA shall be made by wire transfer to a bank account designated by KB at least four (4) business days prior to the date of payment. If any payment is due on a day that is not a business day, such payment instead shall be made on the next succeeding business day. All payments shall be made in United States dollars. Section 5.06 Cost Estimate. By the November 15th preceding any Year in which TR or KB expects to supply KBI or any other Party with any Products (or Intermediate Forms thereof), TR or KB, as the case may be, shall advise KBI and the other Party of its estimates of the unitized Transfer Prices for such Year. In addition, within 30 days after the end of any Quarter in which TR or KB has supplied KBI or any other Party with any Products (or Intermediate Forms thereof), TR or KB, as the case may be, shall provide KBI with an estimate of the cumulative adjustment to the Transfer Price for each such Product or Intermediate Form for the Year that will be required pursuant to Section 5.04(e). Section 5.07 Additional Costs. Each Producer shall be paid for any additional work requested by the Partnership in writing through KBI regarding support of KB Pipeline Products, provided that such work is not otherwise part of the Producer's responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement for which such Producer is to be paid through the Transfer Price. KBI will be invoiced for the actual costs incurred, including manpower support at departmental chargeout rate (this includes all costs of the area supporting the project except payroll and benefits of senior directors and administrators), cost of raw materials, inventory discards and third party charges. No specific overhead allocation will be invoiced. ARTICLE VI MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, DATA AND KNOWHOW FOR INLINE PRODUCTS Section 6.01 Cooperation. TR and KB shall use best efforts to cooperate fully with each other and with KBI and the Partnership, and KBI shall require the Partnership to cooperate fully with TR and KB, towards the end that TR will have the capability, through manufacturing by it, its Affiliates and subcontractors and through the acquisition of raw materials and intermediates from subcontractors or suppliers, to supply the InLine Products (or Intermediate Forms thereof) for which TR is responsible in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to supply the New InLine Products (or Intermediate Forms thereof) for which TR is responsible 33 39 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in sufficient time to permit timely market introduction, as determined by the Partnership, of such New InLine Product in the Territory by the Partnership.

Furthermore, each Producer shall perform quality control, including confirmatory testing, of Intermediate Forms supplied to it by the immediately preceding Earlier Stage Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) as such Producer shall deem appropriate or as required by the FDA. (b) Where a Producer performs only the Packaging and/or Formulation function for a Product, the Producer's obligations to perform such functions are contingent upon its having access to the information to which it would be entitled under Section 9.03, including without limitation, the documents and information in Exhibit V, with respect to the immediately preceding Manufacturing Stage (i.e., Bulk Chemical synthesis, in the case of a Producer performing the Formulation Manufacturing Stage, or Formulation, in the case of a Producer performing the Packaging Manufacturing Stage). (c) While the Partnership shall have final quality control release responsibility for each Product, each Producer shall perform quality control release testing in support of such quality control release. 54 Section 9.03 Access to Records; Inspections; Audits. For the purpose of the quality assurance functions contemplated in Section 9.02, each Producer will, with respect to each Product and Intermediate Form manufactured by it or its Affiliates or subcontractors: (i) upon request by the Subsequent Producer performing the next Manufacturing Stage, provide copies of the relevant batch manufacturing records, relevant quality control records and relevant certificates of analysis for raw materials used by such Producer; and (ii) permit one or more qualified technical specialists of such Subsequent Producer to conduct, at all reasonable times, quality audits of the facility of such Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) where the Products or any Intermediate Forms thereof are manufactured by such Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) and of any other facility which is proposed to be used for such manufacture and of the process of manufacturing and quality control of Products, including, without limitation, the review of all documents specified in Exhibit V, provided, however, that such audit rights shall apply only to the Manufacturing Stage (i.e. the Bulk Chemical or Formulation Manufacturing Stage) immediately preceding the Manufacturing Stage performed by such Subsequent Producer and are subject to such Producer's (or its Affiliate's or subcontractor's) facility availability and strict compliance with and observance of instructions and procedures in respect of confidentiality and security, in order to ensure compliance with this Article. Section 9.04 Inspections and Audits. Each Producer shall further permit one or more qualified technical quality specialists of the Partnership and KB, to conduct inspections and audits at all reasonable times of the facility where the Products or any Intermediate Forms thereof are manufactured by such Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) and any other facility which is proposed to be used for such manufacture and of the process of manufacturing and quality control of Products, including, without limitation, the review of all documents specified in Exhibit V, subject to such Producer's (or its Affiliate's or subcontractor's) facility availability and strict compliance with and observance of instructions and procedures in respect of confidentiality and security, in order to ensure compliance with this Article. Section 9.05 Observations and Conclusions. Observations and conclusions of the Partnership's, KB's and any Producer's audits or inspections of a Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) will be issued to and promptly discussed with the Producer and reasonable corrective action, if needed (as determined by agreement between such Producer in consultation with the Partnership), shall be implemented by the Producer at its own expense. Section 9.06 Certificates of Analysis. Each shipment of Product or Intermediate Form by a Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) shall be accompanied by a certificate of analysis related to each batch of the Intermediate Form of the Product included in such shipment certifying that such shipment conforms to Specifications. Such certificate of analysis shall certify that the Product conforms to Specifications and the C & M Data, and that the Product was manufactured in accordance with GMP. A copy of such certificate of analysis shall also be 49 55 delivered to KBI contemporaneously with the delivery by such Producer to KBI of its invoice for such Product. Section 9.07 Notice of Claims; Replacement Quantities. Unless KBI (or a Subsequent Producer) gives notice to the Producer of a Product (or Intermediate Form) to the contrary within 60 days of delivery by such Producer to KBI (or such other Producer) of a quantity of such Product (or Intermediate Form), such quantity of Product (or Intermediate Form) shall be deemed to be satisfactory to KBI (or such other Producer), subject thereafter only to claims based on or arising from the failure of such Product (or Intermediate Form) to be manufactured in accordance with Section 9.01; provided, however, the foregoing shall not limit anything contained in Article X. If KBI (or such other Producer) notifies the Producer within such 60 days that any quantities of a Product (or Intermediate Form) delivered by the Producer do not conform to the Specifications or C & M Data, or were not manufactured in accordance with GMP, the Producer shall have 30 days to reexamine the same to determine whether it agrees with KBI (or such other Producer). If it agrees, the Producer shall deliver as promptly as practicable new quantities of the Product (or Intermediate Form) for the replacement of the defective quantities at no additional cost to KBI or the Subsequent Producer, and KBI (or such Subsequent Producer) within 60 days thereafter shall notify the Producer of its acceptance or rejection of such replacement quantities. If the Producer disagrees that the original quantities of such Product (or Intermediate Form) are nonconforming, or if KBI (or the other Producer) rejects the Producer's replacement Product (or Intermediate Form) as nonconforming, the matter will be referred to an independent laboratory acceptable to the Producer and KBI (or the other Producer). Testing by the laboratory will be in accordance with NDA procedures. The Producer and KBI (or the other Producer) shall accept the laboratory's opinion and its charges shall be borne equally by the Producer and KBI (or the other Producer). If the laboratory's opinion is that such Product (or Intermediate Form) is nonconforming, the Producer shall deliver as promptly as practicable new quantities of the Product (or Intermediate Form).

ARTICLE XII RECALLS Section 12.01 Recalls and Market Withdrawals. The Partnership may recall or effect a market withdrawal of a Product at any time, after consultation with KB and each Producer with respect to such Product. In addition, KB, after consultation with the Partnership, may, at any time, demand a recall or market withdrawal of a Product of which it (or any of its Affiliates) is the licensor, and, if so requested, the Partnership shall promptly effect such recall or market withdrawal. Furthermore, any Producer, after consultation with the Partnership, may, at any time, demand a recall or market withdrawal of a particular lot of Product of which it or any of its Affiliates is a Producer if it is demonstrated that the recall or market withdrawal of such lot of Product is due to the failure of such Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) or an Earlier Stage Producer of such lot to manufacture such lot according to the Specifications therefor, C&M Data or GMP or for any other reason within the primary quality control responsibility of such Producer, and, if so requested, the Partnership shall promptly effect such recall or market withdrawal. The Partnership and, if applicable, the Party demanding the recall or market withdrawal, shall coordinate the recall or market withdrawal. The Partnership shall bear all costs relating to the recall or market withdrawal unless (i) it is demonstrated that the recall or market withdrawal is due to the failure of a Producer (or its Affiliates or subcontractors) to manufacture such Product according to the Specifications therefor, C & M Data or GMP or for any other reason within the primary quality control responsibility of such Producer, in which case such Producer shall bear the costs relating to the recall or market withdrawal or (ii) such recall or market withdrawal is demanded by KB for a reason other than a reason set forth in (i) above, in which case KB shall bear the costs relating to the recall or market withdrawal. The rights of the Parties to recall or effect a market withdrawal of a Product shall be limited to those set forth in this Section 12.01, the KBI Supply Agreement and the KBI License. ARTICLE XIII SUBCONTRACTING Section 13.01 Right to Subcontract. Subject to Sections 3.01(c), 3.01(e), 4.08 and 4.09, and after informing KBI, any Producer may subcontract the manufacture of any Product or intermediate thereof; provided, however, that any such subcontract shall be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Sections 6.08, 7.08, 10.04 and 10.05 and Article XV, and, upon KBI's or KB's request, such Producer shall require such subcontractor to enter into an undertaking, pursuant to which such 55 61 provisions shall apply directly between such subcontractor and KBI or KB or TR, as the case may be, prior to disclosing to such subcontractor any confidential information of KBI, KB or TR; provided, further, no such subcontract shall release such Producer from any of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent they are performed by such subcontractor; provided, further, that an Alternate Producer may not subcontract such manufacture without the prior written consent of KBI and the Partnership; provided, further, that other than as provided in Sections 3.01(c)(iii), 3.01(c)(v) and 4.06, KB may not subcontract the Formulation Manufacturing Stage of any KB Pipeline Products to a NonAffiliate of KB; and provided, further, that KB USA may not subcontract the Packaging Manufacturing Stage to a NonAffiliate of KB USA. A Producer performing the Bulk Chemical Manufacturing Stage shall as promptly as practicable inform KBI and the Formulator of any subcontract entered into by it with respect to the Bulk Chemical Manufacturing Stage, and a Producer performing the Formulation Manufacturing Stage shall as promptly as practicable inform KBI and the packager of any subcontract entered into by it with respect to the Formulation Manufacturing Stage. If the Transfer Price of a subcontracted Product is calculated in accordance with Exhibit III, Exhibit IVA or Exhibit IVB hereof, subcontracting premium will be charged to KBI only if (i) the Producer delivers or causes to be delivered to the subcontractor an Intermediate Form of such Product or manufacturing process knowhow necessary for the production of such Product and (ii) the Producer provides supervisory oversight or other related services with respect to the subcontractor. Section 13.02 Subcontracting to Another Party. TR and KB may agree that some or all of a Manufacturing Stage for a Product may be subcontracted to the other Party. In such an event, KB or TR, as the case may be, in its capacity as subcontractor shall be entitled to receive from the other Party as payment for performing such subcontract an amount equal to the Transfer Price that would have been paid therefor under Exhibit III, in the case of TR, or Exhibit IVA and Exhibit IVB, as applicable, in the case of KB. The other terms and conditions of any such arrangement shall be set forth in a separate agreement between KB and TR. No such subcontract shall affect the allocation of manufacturing responsibilities set forth in Article III of this Agreement or release a Producer from any of its obligations under this Agreement. ARTICLE XIV RECORDS Each Producer shall keep, and shall cause its Affiliates to keep, true, accurate, and complete records of manufacturing costs, expenses, and capital in sufficient detail to permit the determination of the Transfer Price for each Product (or Intermediate Form) manufactured by it or its Affiliates or subcontractors. At the request and expense of KBI, KBI shall have the right for its then currently engaged independent accountants to have reasonable access at all reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours, to audit and examine, and make copies or extracts of and from, the books, records and accounts of such Producer and its Affiliates as may be necessary in such accountant's judgment to permit it to 56 62 attest that the segments of the Transfer Price charged to KBI by such Producer conform to the terms of this Agreement and, in the event that TR has submitted the winning bid for a Product, that the Bid Price for such Product or Intermediate Form thereof, as adjusted by the Index as provided in the Bid Procedure, will not exceed the price paid or payable based on the Transfer Price computations set forth in Exhibit III, net of the amount paid to an Earlier Stage Producer for the Bulk Chemical included in the Finished Dosage Form. Such rights of access, audit and inspection for any Year shall terminate two years after KBI's receipt of such Producer's final invoice with respect to such Year or, in the case of a bid Product, two years after KBI's receipt of TR's formal notice that the Bid Prices charged by it have not exceeded the Transfer Price for such services under the terms of Exhibit III, net of the amount paid to an Earlier Stage Producer for the Bulk Chemical included in the Finished Dosage Form. KBI shall enter into a written engagement with such accountants, a copy of which shall be provided to the Producer, providing that (i) the scope of the engagement with respect to such audit and examination is limited to the rights provided in this Article XIV and, if the audit is performed in connection with another audit permitted by any other agreement between an Affiliate of such Producer and KBI, the rights of such Affiliate under such other agreement, (ii) such accountants agree to use reasonable efforts, consistent with their professional responsibility, the availability of materials and information and the level of assistance received, to conclude the audit and examination within a reasonable period of time, and (iii) such accountants agree to keep any such information to which they have access pursuant to the foregoing confidential and not to disclose to KBI (or any of its Affiliates) any information other than information relating to the conformance of the Producer's computation of Transfer Price with the terms of this Agreement, and in no event shall quantities or prices or rebates to individual customers be disclosed to KBI (or any of its Affiliates) or any other Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, KBI shall not, during the period from December 15 of any Year through January 31 of the following Year, exercise its rights of access, audit and inspection under this Section and, during the period from February 1 through the last day of February of any Year, exercise such rights with respect to the activities of the Producer during the last Quarter of the prior Year. ARTICLE XV CONFIDENTIALITY Section 15.01 Confidentiality. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2 of the KBI License, each Party and each Alternate Producer (as if such Alternate Producer were a TR Party) shall maintain in strict confidence all Confidential Information pursuant to and in accordance with Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the Master Restructuring Agreement, provided, however, that any Party may disclose such information (other than any privileged or work productprotected information that may have been shared with another Party pursuant to any common or joint interest agreement) to any governmental agency or authority to the extent necessary to obtain the approval of any agency or authority to make and have made Products pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, further, however, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such disclosure shall be made on a confidential and restricted basis. 57 63 ARTICLE XVI MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS Section 16.01 Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified, or supplemented only by a written instrument duly executed by each Party, and may be waived only by a written instrument duly executed by the Party to be bound. No omission or delay on the part of any Party in requiring the due and punctual fulfillment by another Party of any of its obligations hereunder shall constitute a waiver by the omitting or delaying Party of any of its rights to require such due and punctual fulfillment of any obligation hereunder, whether similar or otherwise, or a waiver of any remedy it may have hereunder or otherwise. Section 16.02 Best Efforts; Performance. The obligation of any Party to use its best efforts in any connection shall only require such Party to use such efforts which are reasonable in the circumstances and are consistent with the policies and practices utilized by it in conducting its own business.

Separate dosage levels of a Compound which have the same delivery system and do not differ significantly in the manufacturing processes shall be considered the same Product and may be included in a single bid request. I. BIDS IN RESPECT OF FORMULATION OR PACKAGING OF KB PIPELINE PRODUCTS In the event that the responsibility for the Formulation Manufacturing Stage or the Packaging Manufacturing Stage for a Product is required pursuant to Section 3.01 to be determined in accordance with the Bid Procedure, such responsibility shall be determined by the following procedure on a ProductbyProduct basis. A. Initial Bids 1. Information and Timetable. KB shall provide information to KBI and the Bidding Parties in accordance with Section 7.01. In addition, KB shall provide the Product and Process Information specified in Part III.A of Schedule A ("Product and Process Information") or the Packaging Information specified in Part IV.A of Schedule A ("Packaging Information"), as the case may be, to KBI and such Bidding Parties and will provide to KBI and such Bidding Parties such additional information related thereto as may be reasonably requested by any of the Bidding Parties to permit such Bidding Parties to prepare a bid in a timely and efficient manner; provided, however, that KB shall not be required to provide information concerning the prices paid to vendors for inputs and supplies and other commercial conditions pertaining to such vendors. KB shall inform KBI and such Bidding Parties of the expected date of the delivery of such Product and Process Information. The Parties will use their best efforts to work expeditiously so that Bid Requests (as defined below) can be delivered to the Bidding Parties not less than 28 months prior to the anticipated date of filing of the NDA with respect to such Product. 2. Preliminary Bid Information. Not more than 15 days after the receipt of such Product and Process Information or such Packaging Information, as the case may be, the Partnership will prepare a preliminary bid request containing the information specified in paragraph I.A.3 below in scope and detail comparable to that expected to be included in the formal Request for Bids delivered pursuant to such paragraph, to the extent available, and shall deliver such preliminary bid request to the Bidding Parties as provided in Part II of this Schedule below. The Bidding Parties shall have a reasonable period of time (not less than 15 days) to review such preliminary bid request. The Partnership and KB shall use their best efforts to respond to any reasonable inquiries of any Bidding Party concerning the information and the bid specifications and requirements contained therein. 68 Prior to the delivery of the Request for Bids for the Formulation Manufacturing Stage, TR or an Alternate Producer may waive its right to submit a bid pursuant to the Bid Procedure by delivering written notice of such waiver to KBI in the manner provided in Section 16.05. In such event, KB may elect to perform the Formulation Manufacturing Stage itself or by means of the appointment of a subcontractor as if KB had won the bid pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(iii), and the Transfer Price therefor will be computed in accordance with Exhibits IVA and IVB, as applicable. If KB does not elect to perform the Formulation Manufacturing Stage within 90 days after being notified by KBI that TR or such Alternate Producer has waived its right to submit a bid, paragraph I.A.7 below shall apply. Prior to the delivery of the Request for Bids, KB may waive its right to submit a bid pursuant to the Bid Procedure by delivering written notice of such waiver to KBI in the manner provided in Section 16.05. In such event, paragraph I.A.7 below shall apply. Prior to the delivery of the Request for Bids for the Packaging Manufacturing Stage, TR and any other Person selected by KBI may waive its right to submit a bid pursuant to the Bid Procedure by delivering written notice of such waiver to KBI in the manner provided in Section 16.05. In such event, KB USA may elect to perform the Packaging Manufacturing Stage, and the Transfer Price therefor will be computed in accordance with Exhibit IVB. If KB USA does not elect to perform the Packaging Manufacturing Stage within 90 days after being notified by KBI that TR and such Person has waived its right to submit a bid, paragraph I.A.7 below shall apply. Prior to the delivery of the Request for Bids, KB USA may waive its right to submit a bid pursuant to the Bid Procedure by delivering written notice of such waiver to KBI in the manner provided in Section 16.05. In such event, paragraph I.A.7 below shall apply. 3. Request for Bids. As soon as practicable, but no later than 15 days after the expiration of the preliminary bid request review period provided pursuant to paragraph I.A.2 above, KBI shall invite such Bidding Parties to submit bids to perform the Formulation Manufacturing Stage of the Product or the Packaging Manufacturing Stage of such Product, as the case may be, by delivering to each of such Bidding Parties a formal request for bids (the "Request for Bids") prepared by the Partnership in accordance with Part II of this Schedule A below. Such Request for Bids may include multiple dosage levels of a Product and shall contain the applicable information specified in Part III or Part IV of this Schedule A below and such additional information, reasonable performance standards and other reasonable bid requirements as the Partnership shall determine following consultation with such Bidding Parties, including, without limitation, such additional information that may have been reasonably requested by such Bidding Parties following their receipt of the preliminary bid request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Request for Bids shall not impose any obligations on a successful bidder that are inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement. 4. Bid Preparation. Bids shall be submitted to KBI in conformity with the Request for Bids not later than 90 days after the date of the Request for Bids. Any questions concerning the Request for Bids shall be directed to the Partnership in writing (with a copy to the other Bidding Parties) as provided in Part II below within 60 days following receipt of the Request for Bids. The Partnership shall respond to such questions in writing (with a copy to the other Party) as soon as practicable following the receipt of such questions but not later than 15 days prior to the deadline A2 69 for submission of bids. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of such Bidding Parties shall be entitled to employ a manufacturing process that differs from the process specified in the Request for Bids, provided that such bidder warrants equivalence. 5. Opening and Determination of Winning Bid. No information contained in a bid submitted by a Party shall be disclosed to the other Bidding Parties prior to the determination of the winning bid. In furtherance of this requirement, bids shall be opened simultaneously by KBI at or promptly after the deadline for receipt of bids. In the event a bid covers Formulation of multiple dosage levels of a Product, the winning bid shall be determined on the basis of the lowest volumeweighted average Bid Price, based on volume estimates set forth in the Request for Bids. Not later than 30 days after the deadline for submission of bids, the winning bid will be determined by KBI based on the Bid Price and whether or not such bid meets the requirements set forth in the Request for Bids and KBI shall promptly notify the Bidding Parties of its decision in the manner specified in Part II of this Schedule A and shall include in such notice the Bid Prices of the competing bids. If any of the Bidding Parties contends that the winning bid was not the lowest bid or did not meet the requirements set forth in the Request for Bids, such matter shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 16.11. Each Bidding Party that does not submit the winning bid agrees to return to the Partnership any information provided to such Bidding Party pursuant to the Bid Procedure (and any copies thereof) and shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Article XV. 6. Transfer Price; Adjustments to Bid/Transfer Price. The Bidding Party that submits the winning bid for the Formulation or Packaging, as the case may be, of a Product shall be the Producer of that Product with respect to such Manufacturing Stage, and the Transfer Price for such Manufacturing Stage for that Product will be the sum of (i) the fixed bid price, as adjusted annually on January 1 to reflect any increase or decrease in the Index through August 31 of the year immediately preceding such January 1 (whether or not the bid specifically provides for such an inflation/deflation adjustment) (the "Bid Price"), and (ii) in the case of the Formulation Manufacturing Stage, the Amount Attributable to Bulk Chemical; provided, however, that in no event shall the Bid Price payable to such Producer, as so adjusted, exceed the price that KBI would pay to such Producer based on the Transfer Price computations set forth in Exhibit III (with respect to TR) and Exhibit IVA and IVB (with respect to KB or KB USA), net of the amount paid to an Earlier Stage Producer for the Bulk Chemical included in the Finished Dosage Form (in the case of the Formulation Manufacturing Stage); and provided, further, that for Formulation of a new dosage level of a Product (i.e., a dosage level not covered by a previous bid hereunder) where there is no change in the delivery system or significant change in the manufacturing process, (i) if TR is the current Formulator of such Product, such Producer also shall Formulate such new dosage level, and the Transfer Price payable to TR shall be the Transfer Price as calculated in accordance with Exhibit III and not the Bid Price, as adjusted, (ii) if KB is the current Formulator of such Product, the Producer of such Product shall thereafter be determined in accordance with Section 3.01(c), and (iii) if an Alternate Producer is the current A3 70 Formulator of such Product, the Alternate Producer also shall Formulate such new dosage level, and the Transfer Price payable to such Alternate Producer shall be the price agreed upon between KBI and such Alternate Producer, subject to the approval of the Partnership as set forth in Section 5.01(c). The Bidding Party that submits the winning bid shall be responsible for paying out of the Bid Price (as so adjusted) the Costs and Expenses of Delivery to the extent so required pursuant to Section 4.04. Within 90 days following the end of each Year, the Producer under a winning bid shall certify to KBI and the Partnership that the Bid Price, as so adjusted, does not exceed the price that KBI or the Subsequent Producer would pay to it based on the Transfer Price computations set forth in Exhibit III (with respect to TR or an Alternate Producer), and Exhibits IVA and IVB (with respect to KB or KB USA), net of the amount paid to an Earlier Stage Producer for the Bulk Chemical included in the Finished Dosage Form (in the case of the Formulation Manufacturing Stage). KBI and the Partnership shall have the right to cause such computations and certification to be audited as provided in Article XIV. 7. No Bids Submitted. If (a) KB or KB USA waives its right to submit a bid pursuant to Section I.A.2 or (b) TR waives such right and KB or KB USA, as the case may be, does not elect to perform the relevant Manufacturing Stage, and (c) no other conforming bids are received, subject to the provisions of Section 3.01(d)(iii), KBI shall secure a Producer for such Manufacturing Stage and the Transfer Price for the relevant Manufacturing Stage of that Product will be computed as provided in Section 5.01(c). B. Subsequent Changes 1. Requested Performance that Deviates from Bid Request. In the event the Bidding Party winning the bid is requested to perform in a manner that deviates from the parameters set forth in the Request for Bids or otherwise perform in a manner not contemplated in the Request for Bids, KBI shall reimburse such Producer for the additional costs incurred in performing in accordance with such requests. Examples of such deviations include, among other things, requests to bear shipping costs to or from a location different from that specified in the Request for Bids or to ship Product in a manner different from that specified in the Request for Bids or a change in the Specifications. Such Producer shall provide such documentation as is reasonably available to substantiate such additional costs. 2. Initiation of New Bidding Process. If TR submits the winning bid for a Product and determines at a subsequent date that it is unwilling to continue to supply the Product at the then current price, as determined above, TR shall notify KBI thereof and the Producer for such Product shall thereafter be determined in accordance with Section 3.01(c); provided, however, that TR may take the foregoing actions prior to the date which is three years after the date upon which it commenced performing the Formulation or Packaging of such Product, as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement.

Summary of Pharmacological/Bioavailability Data 82 EXHIBIT III TRANSFER PRICE The Transfer Price for Products and Intermediate Forms thereof produced by TR will be the sum of five segments: 1. Product Cost 2. Period Cost 3. Cost of Capital 4. Subcontracting Premium 5. Costs and Expenses of Delivery Based upon the TR Profit Plan estimates of these five segments (excluding any segment which is billed separately or directly to KBI) a unitized estimate of the Transfer Price will be developed each Year and will be used for invoicing Products shipped to KBI. Invoices will be based on the unitized estimate of the Transfer Price, and the Period Cost and Cost of Capital components of unitized Transfer Price will be adjusted after the end of each Year in accordance with the annual YearEnd settlement procedure contained in Section 5.04 to reflect actual amounts. For purposes of this Exhibit III, KBIRelated Production shall consist of manufacturing of all Products (and Intermediate Forms thereof) for which the Transfer Price is calculated in accordance with this Exhibit III. 1. Product Cost (also known as TR Standard Inventory Cost) will be determined in accordance with TR's usual method of accounting for products made for use as samples or sale. It shall include materials, labor, subcontracting costs and overhead utilized in the factory level production of the chemical entity and for the conversion of that entity to finished packaged pharmaceutical forms. Specific costs will be determined for each individual entity and for each of the various finished forms. These costs will be used for valuing all inventory movements, as Product flows through TR into KBI, in the same manner as such costs are utilized by TR in the development of its financial statements and controls. Attachment A hereto illustrates without limitation, specific items included in such costs. The Products held in TR's inventory for eventual sale to KBI (raw materials, work in process, finished goods and packaging materials) will be revalued effective each January 1st to reflect the revised standard costs applied by TR to its inventory. Within 60 days after each January 1st, TR shall calculate and advise KBI of the total amount of such revaluation as a net increase or decrease to the total standard costs applicable to such Products in inventory at the preceding December 3lst. Within 30 days of such notice, an amount equal to the total amount of such revaluation shall be remitted, in the same manner as provided in Article V for payments for Products, by TR to KBI if such amount is an increase, and by KBI to TR if such amount is a decrease. The calculation and settlement provided for in the preceding two sentences shall be separate from and shall 83 not affect the Year end adjustment of Period Cost and Cost of Capital referred to in Article V and this Exhibit III. 2. Period Cost, the components of which are illustrated without limitation in Attachment B, will also be determined in accordance with TR's usual method of accounting, with the following exceptions: (a) standard revisions amounts representing the change in standard costs of finished goods, work in process, raw materials and packaging materials from one fiscal period to the next fiscal period will not be included in Period Cost; and (b) depreciation will not be included in Period Cost. In addition, only Period Costs of the TR manufacturing Sites where KBI products are produced, as well as an appropriate allocation of period cost at nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted, will be included in determining the allocation of period costs to KBIRelated Production. Period Cost chargeable to KBI will be the sum of individual calculations of Period Cost chargeable for each manufacturing Site involved in KBIRelated Production and an appropriate allocation of Period Costs from nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted utilizing the formula as detailed below. This basis for allocating period costs is known as the "plant specific" methodology. As a part of the calculation of Period Cost chargeable to KBIRelated Production for each manufacturing Site, material variances, discards, and purchase price variances (PPV) will be specifically identified for KBIRelated Production rather than being allocated. Accordingly, material variances, discards, and purchase price variances (PPV) for all products at the Site will be excluded from the Period Cost eligible for allocation. Period Costs at nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted will be allocated to KBIRelated Production utilizing the following approach. First, period costs relating to manufacturing support activities will be identified. Once identified, a fair share of these support costs will be allocated to each manufacturing Site involved in KBIRelated Production. Generally, this identification and allocation process will use methodologies previously established or adopted in the future to support TR's internal reporting. In cases where a specific method does not exist, headcount will be utilized to allocate period cost. Lastly, the period cost allocated to KBIRelated Production for each of the manufacturing Sites will be determined based on the respective percentage of KBIRelated Production at the Site. These percentages will be derived based on the relationship of Site labor and overhead for KBIRelated Production to total Site labor and overhead, both valued at standard cost. PC = A/B X (CD) + E + A/B X (CD) + E + ... + A/B X (CD) + E + F (mfg Site 1) (mfg Site 2) (mfg Site n) where "n" represents the number of manufacturing Sites where KBIRelated Production occurs. A, B, C, D, E and F in the formula shall be calculated in accordance with the same principles described above. The elements of the formula include the following amounts determined for the Year. III2 84 PC = Period Cost charged to KBI by TR. A = Site labor and overhead for KBIRelated Production valued at standard cost. B = Total Site labor and overhead valued at standard cost. C = Total Site period costs. D = Total material variances, discards, and purchase price variances (PPV). E = Material variances, discards, and purchase price variances (PPV) specific to KBIRelated Production. F = Total period costs allocated to KBIRelated Production from nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted. 3. Cost of Capital will be as follows: The annual Cost of Capital shall be the greater of (i) the Minimum Capital Charge multiplied by the number of months in such Year that are within the projected period of Market Exclusivity used to compute such Minimum Capital Charge or (ii) the Total Capital Charge. The Total Capital Charge will be the Total Average Assets Employed for KBIRelated Production for the Year multiplied by a pretax cost of capital rate of 22%. The Total Average Assets Employed for KBIRelated Production for the Year will be determined by the following formula: Total Average Assets Employed Average Inventory (defined below) plus for KBIRelated Production for the Average Gross Properties, Plant and Year = Equipment (defined below) plus Cash (defined below) plus accounts receivable (1/12 of sum of 12 month net accounts receivable balances due TR from KBI) for KBIRelated Production. Average Inventory = 1/12 of (the sum of 12 months ending inventory of product cost of chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms for KBIRelated Production + the sum of 12 months ending inventory of related raw materials and work in process for KBIRelated Production) Cash = 1/12 of (Product Cost charged to KBI for KBIRelated Production + Ending TR inventory of KBI chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms for KBIRelated ProductionBeginning TR inventory of KBI chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms for KBIRelated Production) III3 85 As with period costs, only gross property, plant and equipment of the TR manufacturing Sites where KBIRelated Production occurs, as well as an appropriate allocation of gross property, plant and equipment at nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted and gross property, plant and equipment related to manufacturing or manufacturing support at mixed Sites, will be included in determining the average gross property, plant and equipment for KBIRelated Production. Similar to Period Cost, Average Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment will be the sum of individual calculations of Average Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment utilizing the formula as detailed below. This basis for allocating Average Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment is known as the "plant specific" methodology. Average Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment at nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted will be allocated based on the same methodologies identified to allocate Period Cost for nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted, except that assets located at TR Corporate Headquarters in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey will be excluded. Average gross property, plant and equipment at mixed Sites (i.e., Sites where research, manufacturing or marketing activities are conducted) will include only assets associated with manufacturing or manufacturing support activities. Average Gross A/B x G(1) + G(2) + A/B x G(1) + G(2) +...+ A/B x G(1) + G(2) + H Properties, Plant and Equipment = 2 2 2 (Mfg. Site 1) (Mfg. Site 2) (Mfg. Site n) where "n" represents the number of manufacturing Sites where KBIRelated Production occurs. G(1) = Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment at manufacturing Site at the beginning of Year. G(2) = Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment at manufacturing Site at the end of Year. H = Average Gross Properties, Plant and Equipment allocated to KBIRelated Production from nonmanufacturing Sites where manufacturing support activities are conducted (exclusive of Gross Property, Plant and Equipment located at TR Corporate Headquarters in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.) 4. Subcontracting premium will be 10% of subcontracting costs included in Product Cost incurred by TR for KBIRelated Production. Subcontracting premium will be charged only if (i) TR delivers or causes to be delivered to the subcontractor an Intermediate Form of the relevant Product or manufacturing process knowhow necessary for the production of such Product and (ii) TR provides supervisory oversight or other related services with respect to the subcontractor. III4 86 All manufacturing including Packaging by a third party of intermediates after and including the steps in which the active drug is formed shall be considered as subcontracting. In cases where KB or an Affiliate of TR is chosen as a subcontractor, no subcontracting premium will apply. 5. Costs and Expenses of Delivery associated with KBIRelated Production, consistent with Section 5.03, shall be invoiced to KBI or the Subsequent Producer (either separately or as part of the Transfer Price) unless they are paid directly by KBI or the Subsequent Producer. SPECIAL PROVISION CONCERNING ENALAPRIL/FELODIPINE COMBINATION PRODUCTS The Transfer Price for Enalapril/Felodipine Combination Products for purposes of the Supply Agreement dated as of November 1, 1994 between TR and KBI, as amended, governing the supply of Enalapril/Felodipine Combination Products shall be computed in the same manner as the Transfer Price hereunder for InLine Products as set forth in paragraph (a) of Section 5.01 of this Agreement for Enalapril/Felodipine Combination Product sold in the years 1998 through 2000 and as set forth in paragraph (b) of Section 5.01 of this Agreement for Enalapril/Felodipine Combination Product sold after the year 2000. III5 87 ATTACHMENT A PRODUCT COST Material (raw materials, filling and packaging supplies) Subcontracting Costs Labor (direct labor) Overhead (indirect labor/supervision, operating supplies, testing charges, waste disposal charges, maintenance expense and utilities, and all other expenses related to factory production) 88 ATTACHMENT B PERIOD COST Period costs in TR's usual method of accounting includes standard revision and depreciation, however, these costs will be excluded from the total period cost allocated to KBI. Material variances, discards, and purchase price variances (PPV) related to KBI products will be specifically identified and charged to KBI. Therefore, these categories of variances for all products will be excluded from the period cost base allocated to KBI. All other classes of variances will be included in period costs allocated to KBI. Unused Capacity Expenses (fixed expenses not absorbed into inventory and relating to the underutilization of the production of such items as steam, heat and power) Materials Management Expenses (expenses for the purchasing department, production control and warehouses) Quality Control Expenses Real Estate Taxes Insurance General Services (administration and all other expenses related to production but not included in Product Cost) 89 EXHIBIT IVA TRANSFER PRICE The Transfer Price for Products and Intermediate Forms thereof produced by KB in pilot or laboratory scale production ("KBIRelated Pilot Production") will be the sum of four segments: 1. Product Cost 2. Site Overhead 3. Cost of Capital 4. Costs and Expenses of Delivery The Transfer Price will be calculated separately for each Manufacturing Stage. Based upon the annual KB Budget estimates of these four segments (excluding any segment which is billed separately or directly to KBI), a unitized estimate of the Transfer Price will be developed each Year and will be used for invoicing Products shipped to KBI or any Producer. Invoices will be based on the unitized estimate of the Transfer Price and the unitized Transfer Price will be adjusted after the end of each Year in accordance with the annual YearEnd settlement procedure contained in Section 5.04. 1. Product Cost will include all costs related to KBIRelated Pilot Production in KB's departments of Pharmaceutical Development, or its successor or comparable function, including subcontracting costs. These allocated costs, however, will not include the expenses of Clinical R&D, or PreClinical R&D. The Product Cost shall be determined in accordance with KB's usual method of accounting for internal projects, where the following costs are reasonably allocated to the Product: a) Project related external costs (consultants, license fees, supplies, etc.). Also included here are variable charges from KB's Chemical Development department. b) Multiproject related external costs (as above but related to more than one project). c) Direct project workers, e.g. employment cost (salary and salaryrelated costs), consumables, travel, education, subscriptions, etc. Direct project workers are those with 10% or more of the manyear of each such worker devoted to a project. A manyear is defined as a fulltime employee (FTE) with 220 working days (gross) per year (giving approximately 180 days net efficient time). A crossfunctional average manyear cost per company is to be used in the budget process. The data is updated annually by KB's Control department. d) Common scientific costs include nonproject scientific workers devoting less than 10% of the manyear of each such worker to a project, as well as other IVA1 90 administrative staff in the pharmaceutical function. These costs are not shown at project level, only as a total overhead cost within each category. Depreciation shall be excluded. 2. Site Overhead is made up of the onsite service functions not performed by the Pharmaceutical Development Departments. This includes but is not limited to company management, finance, human resources, information service and technology, legal and information, library, office service, security, site services, utilities, repairs and maintenance. KB corporate headquarters functions and marketing and manufacturing activities are not part of Site Overhead. The Site Overhead shall be allocated to the Products by way of the number of FTES included in the Product Cost. 3. Cost of Capital will be charged using a pretax cost of capital rate of 22%. For purposes of calculating the Cost of Capital charge, the pretax cost of capital rate will be applied to the Total Average Assets Employed for KBIRelated Pilot Production for each Year. KB corporate headquarters functions are not part of the Cost of Capital. The Total Average Assets Employed for KBIRelated Pilot Production for the Year shall be determined by the following formula, applied to each Site: Total Average Assets = Average Inventory (defined below), plus Employed for KBIRelated Cash (defined below), plus Average Gross Pilot Production for the Fixed Assets (defined below) plus Accounts Year Receivable (defined below). Average Inventory = 1/12 of (the sum of 12 months ending inventory of Product Cost of chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms produced by KB for KBIRelated Pilot Production + the sum of 12 months ending inventory of related raw materials and work in process for KBIRelated Pilot Production) Cash = 1/12 of Product Cost charged to KBI for KBIRelated Pilot Production Only gross fixed assets of the KB Sites where KBIRelated Pilot Production occurs will be included in determining the average gross fixed assets for KBIRelated Pilot Production. Average Gross Fixed = The average of opening and closing Assets balances of gross fixed assets used for KBIRelated Pilot Production. The fixed assets used for KBIRelated Pilot Production shall be calculated as a share of the Pharmaceutical Development department fixed assets, proportionate to the share of KBIRelated Pilot Production time or cost related to the total time or cost of the Pharmaceutical Development department, plus a share of the IVA2 91 fixed assets used for Site Overhead, allocated by way of occupied floor area, number of employees or other fair allocation method to reflect use of resources. Accounts Receivable = 1/12 of the sum of 12 months' net accounts receivable balances due KB from KBI for KBIRelated Pilot Production 4. Costs and Expenses of Delivery, associated with KBIRelated Pilot Production, consistent with Section 5.03, will be invoiced to KBI or the Subsequent Producer (either separately or as part of the Transfer Price) unless they are paid directly by KBI or the Subsequent Producer. Conversion to United States dollars from Swedish Krona at the average of the twelve monthly average exchange rates for the Year used by KB for financial reporting. IVA3 92 EXHIBIT IVB TRANSFER PRICE The Transfer Price for Products and Intermediate Forms thereof produced by KB other than in pilot or laboratory scale production ("KBIRelated Commercial Production") will be the sum of four segments: 1. Product Cost 2. Cost of Capital 3. Manufacturing Support Costs 4. Costs and Expenses of Delivery The Transfer Price will be calculated separately for each Manufacturing Stage. Based upon the annual KB Budget estimates of these four segments (excluding any segment which is billed separately or directly to KBI), a unitized estimate of the Transfer Price will be developed each Year and will be used for invoicing Products shipped to KBI or any Producer. Invoices will be based on the unitized estimate of the Transfer Price and the unitized Transfer Price will be adjusted after the end of each Year in accordance with the annual YearEnd settlement procedure contained in Section 5.04 and in the Section entitled "PreCalculated Transfer Price and Actual Transfer Price" in this Exhibit IVB. For purposes of this Exhibit IVB, KBIRelated Commercial Production shall consist of manufacturing of all Products (and Intermediate Forms thereof) for which the Transfer Price is calculated in accordance with this Exhibit IVB. 1. Product Cost will equal KB Factory Cost less depreciation. KB Factory Cost will be determined in accordance with KB's usual method of accounting for products made for use as samples or sale. It shall include materials, labor, subcontracting costs, license fees (excluding royalties which have been taken into account under Section 3.7(c) of the Master Restructuring Agreement) and overhead utilized in the factory level production of the chemical entity and for the conversion of that entity to finished packaged pharmaceutical forms. Specific costs will be determined for each individual entity and for each of the various finished forms. Attachment A hereto illustrates, without limitation, specific items included in such costs. Depreciation is included in different activities. It will be excluded by using the following formula, applied to each manufacturing Site. The intent of applying the following formula is to approximate the result that would have been obtained if depreciation were not included. IVB1 93 B/C x A Where: A = total depreciation of the manufacturing Site B = total Factory Costs (other than materials consumption) as above for KBIRelated Commercial Production C = total Factory Costs (other than materials consumption) as above of the manufacturing Site 2. Cost of Capital. The annual Cost of Capital shall be the greater of (i) the Minimum Capital Charge multiplied by the number of months in such Year that are within the projected period of Market Exclusivity used to compute such Minimum Capital Charge or (ii) the Total Capital Charge. For purposes of calculating the Total Capital charge, the pretax cost of capital rate 22% will be applied to the Total Average Assets Employed for KBICommercial Production for the Year. Cost of Capital will be charged as a portion of the unitized estimates of the Transfer Price based on the annual KB Budget. Astra corporate headquarters functions are not part of Cost of Capital. The Total Average Assets Employed for KBIRelated Commercial Production for the Year will be determined by the following formula, applied to each manufacturing Site: Total Average Assets Employed for Average Inventory (defined below) plus KBIRelated Commercial Average Gross Fixed Assets (defined below) Production for the Year = plus Cash (defined below) plus accounts receivable (1/12 of sum of 12 month net accounts receivable balances due KB from KBI or any Producer for KBIRelated Commercial Production) Average Inventory = 1/12 of (the sum of 12 months ending inventory of Product Cost of chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms produced by KB for KBIRelated Commercial Production + the sum of 12 months ending inventory of related raw materials and work in process for KBIRelated Commercial Production) Cash = 1/12 of (Product Cost charged to KBI for KBIRelated Commercial Production + Ending KB inventory of KBI chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms for KBIRelated Commercial Production Beginning KB inventory of KBI chemical entities and finished and packaged pharmaceutical forms for KBI Related Commercial Production) IVB2 94 Only gross fixed assets of the KB manufacturing Sites where KBIRelated Commercial Production occurs will be included in determining the average gross fixed assets for KBIRelated Commercial Production. Average Gross Fixed Assets = The average of opening and closing balances of gross fixed assets used for KBIRelated Commercial Production. The assets at the manufacturing Site shall be allocated to products and finished packaged forms by the same method as depreciation above. 3. Manufacturing Support Costs are costs for activities conducted within the Manufacturing & Logistics organization (or its successor) and not at the manufacturing Sites. It includes without limitation activities regarding construction and facilities for which costs are not capitalized, environmental affairs, logistics, purchasing coordination and quality management. In case these costs are not allocated to factories or manufacturing Sites within KB's internal reporting, headcount will be utilized to allocate these costs. The manufacturing support costs allocated to each Site will be further allocated to KBIRelated Commercial Production using the following formula: K x H/J, where K = share of manufacturing support costs for Site H = total Factory Costs (other than materials consumption) at precalculated price for actual volume of KBIRelated Commercial Production at Site. J = total Factory Costs (other than materials consumption) at precalculated price for total volume at Site. 4. Costs and Expenses of Delivery associated with KBIRelated Commercial Production, consistent with Section 5.03, shall be invoiced to KBI or the Subsequent Producer (either separately or as part of the Transfer Price) unless they are paid directly by KBI or the Subsequent Producer. PRECALCULATED TRANSFER PRICE AND ACTUAL TRANSFER PRICE An estimated unit price per item, the PreCalculated Transfer Price, based on KB's standard cost and budget assumptions, will be communicated to KBI by October 15th each Year, according to Article XVI. This price will be used as a preliminary Transfer Price for the following year. The PreCalculated Transfer Price will be adjusted according to Section 5.04 according to the following method: Material variances, discards and purchase price variances will be specifically identified for KBIRelated Commercial Production. IVB3 95 Cost of capital will be calculated based on actual volume, average accounts receivable, Average Inventory and Average Gross Fixed Assets. Calculation difference (G), computed as follows: G = D E F will be determined, where D = actual Product Cost for actual volume at Site. E = total material variances, discards and purchase price variations at Site. F = Product Cost at precalculated price for actual volume at Site. The calculation difference will be allocated to the KBIRelated Commercial Production from each Site using the following formula: G x H / J where G = the calculation difference as defined above H = total Factory Costs (other than materials consumption) at precalculated price for actual volume of KBIRelated Production at Site. J = total Factory Costs (other than materials consumption) at precalculated price for total volume at Site. Conversion to United States dollars from Swedish Krona at the average of the twelve monthly average exchange rates for the Year used by KB for financial reporting. IVB4 96 ATTACHMENT A FACTORY COST Factory cost in KB's usual method of accounting includes depreciation, however depreciation will be excluded from the total costs allocated to KBI.
