In no event shall audits be made more frequently than semiannually unless the immediately preceding audit disclosed a material discrepancy. 4. DISPUTES 4.1 In the event any controversy or claim arises between the parties to this Agreement, they will attempt in good faith to negotiate a solution to their differences by elevating the issue to senior management for resolution and, if negotiation does not result in a resolution within 30 days, they agree to participate in good faith mediation as administered by the American Arbitration Association. In the event of threatened or actual irreparable harm, a party may elect to bypass this Section and proceed directly pursuant to Sections 4.2 or 4.4. 4.2 Any controversy or claim between the parties to this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, statute, or other legal theory (including but not limited to any claim of infringement, fraud or misrepresentation), which cannot be resolved by negotiation or mediation will be resolved by arbitration pursuant to this section and the thencurrent Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association. The duty to arbitrate will extend to any employee, officer, shareholder, agent, or affiliate of a party hereto making or defending a claim which would be subject to arbitration if brought by a party hereto. If any part of this section is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate hereunder or any other part of this section. 4.3 The arbitration will be held in the US headquarters city of the party not initiating the claim before a sole arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and electronic data processing systems. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will not have the power to award any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the state or nation specified in this Agreement. Each party will bear its own attorney's fees associated with the arbitration and other costs and expenses of the arbitration will be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. 4.4 If a party breaches any provision of this Agreement related to the other party's or the other party's supplier's intellectual property, the other party will have no adequate Page 5 remedy at law and may petition a court of law for injunctive relief to protect the intellectual property. 5. GENERAL 5.1 Assignment. No assignment of this Agreement by a party will be valid without the prior written consent of the other party which will not be unreasonably withheld.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. NCR, if it sells an operating unit that is using this Agreement, may replicate this Agreement to such operating unit. 5.2 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect provided the intent of the parties has not been materially frustrated. 5.3 Excused Performance.

Subject to Section 5.3, acceptance by NCR of such percentage of its Orders will not be a waiver of any rights or remedies which NCR may have as a result of Solectron's failure to ship all ordered Products and Parts. 5.6 Affiliate Participation. All rights granted to NCR in this Agreement may be exercised by any Affiliate of NCR agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

Nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or franchise relationship. 5.14 Periods of Time.

Modified VII Contracts statement Y2K Solution Team Deleted OS & APPLICATION Question: "Dependent on other products being Year 2000 Qualified in order to attain Qualification" Page 88 NCR and Year 2000 Qualification Meaning of "Year 2000 Qualification" The purpose of this document is to provide NCR's customers, partners, suppliers, and employees a definition for Products that are "Year 2000 Qualified." This document will evolve over time as more information about the requirements and testing are known. I. "Year 2000 Qualification" means that a Product has been reviewed to confirm that it stores, processes (including sorting and performing mathematical operations), inputs, and outputs data containing date information correctly regardless of whether the data contains dates before, on, or after January 1, 2000. Products which do not perform date manipulation, and which do not alter any date information that flows through them, are also considered Year 2000 Qualified. II. Specifically: Dates before, on or after January 1, 2000 may be interpreted and stored using either "FORMAT" or "CONVENTION" techniques. As used by NCR, "Year 2000 Qualification" means that the FORMAT technique is used. However, Qualification by CONVENTION may be used in circumstances where compliance by FORMAT is impractical, or where CONVENTION is required to meet specific external interface requirements; in that case the convention used must be specifically documented. "FORMAT" and "CONVENTION" have the following definitions: FORMAT: All dates are stored, processed, input, and output in formats that preserve century, decade, and year information. CONVENTION: Dates are stored, input, or output in a format that preserves only decade and year information, but are processed through a "sliding window" calculation. For example, if the year is 00 to 70, add 2000, and if the year is 71 to 99, add 1900. There is no industry standard for the "cutoff" date used in such calculations, and therefore interfaces may not work correctly between programs or systems using different conventions. Any Product achieving Qualification through CONVENTION must clearly document the cutoff date and any other necessary information relating to the bridging calculation used. This documentation must be included in the product's entry in the NCR Year 2000 Qualification List. III. Leap Year The year 2000 itself must be correctly processed as a leap year. In other words, the two days following February 28, 2000 must properly be interpreted as Tuesday, February 29, 2000, and Wednesday, March 1, 2000. Page 89 IV. Display Any display of a date, whether on screens or in reports, should use a fourdigit year (YYYY). However, if twodigit display of a date is commonly accepted and does not cause confusion, the year field may be displayed as two digits. V. Firmware and Hardware Any firmware, hardware, or networking component in a Year 2000 Qualified computer platform must process dates in accordance with this Definition. Vl. System Integration Year 2000 Qualification extends only to the specific product configuration tested, and does not include other software, firmware, or hardware products which may be used in conjunction with the tested configuration. For a Product configuration consisting of multiple components to be considered "Year 2000 Qualified," each constituent component, regardless of vendor, must be "Year 2000 Qualified" in accordance with this Definition, and the system as a whole must be tested for Year 2000 Qualification. "Constituent components" include all software (including operating systems, programs, packages, and utilities), firmware, hardware, networking components, and peripherals provided as part of the configuration. Vll. Contracts All contracts with vendors for products to be used in the computer system or platform MUST state that Year 2000 Qualification is a performance requirement. VIII. Year 2000 Product Qualification Requirements All of the following questions must be answered as indicated or "NA" for any Product to be identified as "Year 2000 Qualified." Any deviations from these responses must be specifically documented, and approved by NCR. Page 90 [x] DATE MANIPULATION QUESTIONS NA No Yes Does the product: 1.
