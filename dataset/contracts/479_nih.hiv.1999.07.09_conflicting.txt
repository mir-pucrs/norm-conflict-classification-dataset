REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS FOR INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS The primary purpose of the Public Health Service (PHS) is to support and advance independent research within the scientific comnmnunity. This support is provided in the form of contracts and grants totaling approximately 7 billion dollars annually. PHS has established effective, time tested and well recognized procedures for stimulating and supporting this independent research by selecting from multitudes of applications those research projects most worthy of support within the constraints of its appropriations. The reimbursement through the indirect cost mechanism of independent research and development costs not incidental to product improvement would circumvent this competitive process. To ensure that all research and development projects receive similar and equal consideration, all organizations may compete for direct funding of independent research and development projects they consider worthy of support by submitting those projects to the appropriate Public Health Service grant office for review. Since these projects may be submitted for direct funding, the Contractor agrees that no costs for any independent research and development project, including all applicable indirect costs, will be claimed under this contract. ARTICLE H.2. HUMAN SUBJECTS It is hereby understood and agreed that research involving human subjects shall not be conducted under this contract, and that no material developed, modified, or delivered by or to the Government under this contract, or any subsequent modification of such material, will be used by the Contractor or made available by the Contractor for use by anyone other than the Government, for experimental or therapeutic use involving humans without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.

END of the SCHEDULE (CONTRACT) 27 Contract No. N01AI95373 STATEMENT OF WORK ATTACHMENT A BACKGROUND The development of a vaccine to prevent the spread of HIV infection has been identified by the NIAID as a goal of the highest priority. While advances in immunology and molecular biology continue to offer an ever expanding array of approaches to the development of new candidates, the limited capacity to move promising concepts through the development process presents a substantial barrier to the full achievement of this potential. Limited industry involvement in key areas, especially international (nonclade B) vaccines, calls for a nontraditional, more active and developmentally oriented response by NIH and NIAID to meet the public health threat of the AIDS epidemic. Resources that could rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps would greatly enhance the capacity to respond to emerging needs identified by NIAID and its advisory groups. The HIV Vaccine Production Contract will support applied research that is not adequately being pursued by industry and will further develop leads derived from investigatorinitiated research. INTRODUCTION The objective of the Contract is to provide to the NIAID with a full range of developmental resources to bring an HIV vaccine concept from the laboratory to initial human testing. It is envisioned that the ability to encourage and to support the development of multiple approaches will result in a shared knowledge base from which the best vaccine prototypes will emerge. STATEMENT OF WORK WORK STATEMENT for the HIV Vaccine Production Contract. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of the contract, directly or through subcontractors and/or consultants, as needed to undertake targeted research essential to translating basic research concepts into prototype vaccine products, under the direction of NIAID staff and as commended by existing and ad hoc NIAID advisory groups. Statement of Work ATTACHMENT 1 (07/09/99) 1 Page 1 Contract No. NO1AI95373 Specifically, the Contractor shall: PART A: VACCINE PRODUCTION 1. Produce, scaleup, characterize and formulate specific vaccine antigens and reagents as directed by the Project Officer via a Task Order issued by the NIAID, Produce pilot lots of candidate vaccines under GLP/cGMP appropriate for Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials, at the direction of the Project Officer in one or more of the following vaccine Categories: (a) Synthetic peptidesClinical grade purified HIV peptide vaccines. (b) Recombinant subunitsClinical grade purified subunit vaccines. (c) Plasmid DNA vaccinesClinical grade recombinant plasmid DNA with sequence(s) of genes relevant to AIDS vaccines. (d) Vector based vaccinesClinical grade recombinant vaccines containing relevant genes (eg. vaccinia, avipox, adenovirus, polio, BCG, Salmonella, etc.). (e) Whole killed/Viruslike Particle Clinical grade nonviable HIV1 virus vaccine. (f) Live attenuated virusAttenuated HIV1 virus vaccine. 2. Develop and manufacture specific vaccine products. a) Consult and coordinate with the product inventor throughout the development process. Complete a material transfer agreement, if needed. b) Develop detailed production plan and budgets for manufacture of lots of candidate vaccine products prior to undertaking GLP/cGMP production. c) Assure that facilities and all planned procedures meet FDA standards and requirements prior to GLP/cGMP production. d) Prepare, where applicable, master stocks, cell banks, bacterial or viral clones, etc. e) Purchase, where applicable, products and materials necessary for vaccine production. Statement of Work ATTACHMENT 1 (07/09/99) 2 Page 2 Contract No. NO1AI95373 f) Optimize expression in systems suitable for vaccine production and scaleup production to required capacity. g) Maintain an inventory of test and pilot lots of vaccine candidates that have been produced. Periodically, as required, examine titer or potency of vaccine products. h) Produce reagents necessary for the testing or evaluation of immune responses to vaccine products. i) Ship the manufactured, packaged, and labeled dosage forms utilizing shipping procedures and materials to maximize product stability. j) Manage and account for intellectual property rights that preexist or may develop through the activities of the Contractor, including maintenance of security of confidential and/or proprietary data. 3. Provide facilities, equipment and resources: a) Receive, store and manipulate biohazardous materials (Biosafety Level 2 and 3 Containment as required) and maintain their viability in facilities which provide aseptic and/or sterile conditions as appropriate. b) Maintain and operate controlled storage of samples at appropriate temperatures with appropriate monitoring for failure (Room temperature through 90 (degree) C. liquid nitrogen storage may be required for some products). e) Provide facilities and equipment suitable for GLP/cGMP production of vaccine products. d) Provide protective garments, equipment and sufficient monitoring to assure safe handling of potentially hazardous materials, including radioactive materials, for the safety and protection of workers. e) Conduct work under the contract in accordance with all applicable and current Federal, state, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations, as well as all PHS Safety and Health provisions) 4. Perform vaccine lot characterization tests. At various steps during the manufacture of a vaccine the product must be characterized. Prior to use of a vaccine in clinical studies the manufactured vaccine will need to undergo final lot release testing. As described in the regulations for General Biological Product Standards (21 CFR 610) the following tests must be performed for each lot of vaccine.
