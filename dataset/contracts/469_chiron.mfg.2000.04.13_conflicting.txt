(iv) In the event that the manufacture of a portion of a Product lot fails to conform to the Procedures resulting from Chiron's negligence or misconduct, the Customer shall only pay Chiron a prorated fee only for the conforming portion of the lot. Chiron shall credit the Customer for the prorated cost of the nonconforming portion of the Other Materials. (v) The party that pays for the cost of the replacement bulk product defined in sections (i) through (iv) above shall also pay for the cost of disposal of the rejected Product.

Chiron will work with EntreMed to determine whether such change will have a schedule or financial impact on the project. If it does, Chiron business development will prepare a change order documenting the change, cost and schedule impact and implement the change, to the extent practical, after the designated EntreMed representative approves the change order in writing and returns it to Chiron. Chiron will use reasonable effort to accommodate changes that do not negatively impact its regulatory license or cGMP status, other products or processes. PROCESS CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION: During largescale development or cGMP runs, EntreMed may request process changes that have no impact on Chiron products. EntreMed recognizes that during cGMP runs, such changes will made in accordance with approved Chiron change control procedures and may result in a deviation being issued. EntreMed will communicate the requested change to Chiron project manager in writing on a form that the parties agree to prior to the start of the development runs. EntreMed is prohibited from requesting a change directly through an operator. If the Chiron project manager determines that the change is safe and will not jeopardize equipment, the change will be implemented immediately. Changes during production such as modifying a process control parameter or changing the sequence to operate a manual valve typically do not result in any cost impact unless such changes are to be made permanent resulting in a need to modify and approve SOPs. In the event that a change has a cost impact, such as a request to perform additional assays, the cost will be determined at the Additional Services Rate and documented as a change order after the run is completed. Chiron shall not change any processing parameters for the manufacture of the Product that could affect EntreMed's process validation, without prior written agreement from EntreMed. CUSTOM MANUFACTURING REPORTS: EntreMed may request that Chiron provide a custom manufacturing report for each lot or campaign. The reports would consolidate information from Chiron's standard lot package into a format specified by EntreMed. Time to develop, format and complete a custom report for each lot or campaign and for Chiron QA to review and approve such report would be additional services. 16 33 [". . ."

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES: EntreMed will provide a preliminary Bill of Materials (BOM) and specifications/acceptable grades for required raw materials and supplies no later than the dates shown on the Project Schedule, Figure 2. Chiron will prepare the final Bill of Materials. Chiron will purchase raw materials, supplies and consumables in accordance with its approved procedures using EntreMed's specifications. Raw materials, supplies and consumables include all materials that are used in the production process such as the following: Media Glucose sources Trace metals Process and buffer chemicals Chromatography resins Inprocess filters and membranes Disposable product contact tubing Buffer bags, transport bags and bulk product containers Other materials used to support standard utilities and process operations such as pure water, clean air, HVAC, clean steam, gowning apparel are included in the Facility Use Fees further specified in Section 16. To minimize costs, Chiron will place one order for each raw material of sufficient quantity for the entire production campaign (including raw materials for equipment testing and sham runs), if practicable, and two extra VMF lots and two extra CMF lots for safety stock. During the production campaign, Chiron will order additional raw materials and supplies as required such that safety stocks for two extra VMF lots and two extra CMF lots will always be maintained. The Bill of Materials must be finalized at least 2 months prior to the start of production. Changes to the Bill of Materials within 2 months to the start of production could jeopardize the project schedule. If changes to the Bill of Materials result in raw materials not being available at the scheduled start of production and thus result in an idle facility, then EntreMed will pay Chiron the applicable facility idle fees specified in Section 16. Chiron will perform an identity "ID" test on incoming raw materials and supplies for their qualified vendors. Chiron will retain raw material samples in accordance with its approved procedures and the terms of this Agreement. OPTIONAL RAW MATERIAL VENDOR QUALIFICATION: For the qualification/validation lots, Chiron, or its contractor will perform certain compendial QC testing on incoming raw materials as agreed to by the Planning Team. Chiron will qualify new vendors required under this Agreement. This work would be performed only for new vendors or raw materials that have not previously been qualified by Chiron. Fees for the optional raw material vendor qualification and compendial testing will be treated as additional services by Chiron. 27 44 [". . ."

ANALYTICAL: Chiron personnel may visit EntreMed, if required, and witness the methods at EntreMed's current contractor. EntreMed will then make available inprocess analytical methods, listed on Table 3 as EntreMed's methods, to Chiron and train Chiron operators on the performance of such analytical methods. Transfer data may be utilized to support EntreMed's method validation. Chiron will perform all assays listed on Table 3 for all full scale development and cGMP lots with the exception that the working cell bank ID test will be performed only once for each bank that is sent to Chiron. For assays provided by EntreMed, as indicated in Table 3, the following system will apply to demonstrate equivalent assay performance at EntreMed and Chiron laboratories: |X| EntreMed will provide the standards (control reference standards including applicable protein pool samples and including final bulk product showing the range of ". . .") and Process Validation Protocols |X| Chiron will confirm acceptance of the control reference standards |X| Chiron will generate SOPs based on the protocols, if necessary |X| Chiron will then perform assays per EntreMed's protocols or Chiron's SOPs, as applicable |X| Chiron will provide the data summary to EntreMed as specified per EntreMed protocols or Chiron SOPs, as appropriate |X| Chiron will provide a copy of the raw data to EntreMed |X| EntreMed will write the equivalency/validation report For validated assays provided by EntreMed, Chiron will run the assays as mutually agreed to demonstrate that the assays perform equivalently at EntreMed and Chiron laboratories (equivalency studies). However, Chiron will not perform any assay validation testing or services such as sensitivity, robustness, limitation of quantitation, limitation of detection, and interday or intraday variability. For unvalidated assays provided by EntreMed, Chiron will perform covalidation services such as sensitivity, robustness, limitation of quantitation, limitation of detection, and interday or intraday variability, if requested by EntreMed in writing. If such covalidation services require more Chiron resources than the equivalency study described above, then the additional resources will be provided as additional services. For assays provided by Chiron, listed on Table 3, if any such assays require modification or development to perform properly with EntreMed's product and matrix, such work would be performed as additional services, if requested by EntreMed in writing. For assays provided by Chiron, listed on Table 3, Chiron will perform validation services such as sensitivity, robustness, limitation of quantitation, limitation of detection, and interday or intraday variability, if necessary, for use of the assay with EntreMed's process, and if requested by EntreMed in writing.
